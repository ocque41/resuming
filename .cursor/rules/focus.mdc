# - Optimize the content and design of the optimized cv result document.
(all flags --DONE means they are fixed or implemented and we shall no worry about anymore)(everthing that has flags " -- " is top number one priority to focus on while implementing)

# - do not go implement a bunch of things without permision only focus on this priority focus

- generate the specific tab system, this system is very similar to the general except the cv will be optimized based on the copyed and pasted the user desired job description and the AI adjusting the CV keywords and make it the perfect fit for the job--DONE

this system is a completelly new functionality that does not has to do anything with the general for that reason do not edit the general optimize cv to match both general and specific, create a new function for the specific with a lookalike functionality to the general but DO NOT conflict the two they are separate functions and one serves a completelly different purpose to the other--DONE

- the system base is complete lets move on to enhancing the content showing in the optimized cv:
    - sections to extract and optimize content based on so the sections has optimize content of original data.
        - Header
            contact
        - Profile
            brief about me section
        - Achievements
            3 bullet points of the best achievements acomplished through out the entire user career
        - Goals
            3 bullet points of what the user wants to acomplish at the company it is applying to
        - Languages
        - Skills
        - Education

--reminder the general tab system functionlity is the best in the world, please please do not touch it for any any reason, the specific tab should work completelly separate with completelly new systems, desings and functionality almost like a new page but copy the UI of the general tab and copy the document desing generation.
do not touch anything of the general tab or we will just try again reverting the implementation please
