# - Optimize the content and design of the optimized cv result document.
(all flags --DONE means they are fixed or implemented and we shall no worry about anymore)(everthing that has flags " -- " is top number one priority to focus on while implementing)


# - do not go implement a bunch of things without permision only focus on this priority focus

# - I like your analysis and that we agree
your plan seams reliable, lets try it, remember it should be quick implementation with minor adjustments we currently just want to make the system work so we can work on the results, lets not add a lot of things or making mayor changes because we will be trapped in a errors loophole

# - lets keep it functioning
our instructions now would be to do micro adjustments or micro implementations step by step to see the result get better little by little without breaking the system or code so we can keep on iterating and improving little by little, step by step

# - remember minor adjustments
remember little by little step by step, we do not want to make mayor changes in the specific system because is curretly working

# - I fully trust you and I know you will implement amazing things.
continue freely to perfect the general and specific systems when it comes to perfecting the optimizing and formating of the cv results, if you need approach guidance for organized implementation you can consult the systematic-implementation and focus rules
