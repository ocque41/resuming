## - IF YOU RECOMMEND AN IMPLEMENTATION ONLY FOCUS ON MAKING IT WORK COMPLETELY, YOU CAN TAKE YOUR TIME TO IMPLEMENT IT WELL THROUGH BUT IF YOU ARE GOING TO SEMI IMPLEMENT A FEATURE DO NOT IMPLEMENT IT AT ALL. PLAN AHEAD OF IMPLEMENTATION AND COME UP WITH EVALUATION METRICS YOURSELF BEING RUNNING A COMMAND OR ANALYZING THE CODE. ANYTHING NEW YOU IMPLEMENT BASED ON YOUR RECOMMENDATION WITHOUT SPECIFIC PROMPT FROM ME BE SURE TO IMPLEMENT IT 100% MAKING SURE NOTHING IS MISSING, DO GO AND USE EXAMPLE DATA OR ONLY MAKING THE FRONTEND, ETC... IMPLEMENT IT COMPLETELY AND SECURLY FOR ME TO TEST, IF IT FAILS AT SOME POINT I WILL SEND YOU EVALUATION ON IT AND WE CAN CONTINUE BUT DO NOT MAKE TEST SOMETHING THAT WILL 100% WILL HIT AN ERROR BECAUSE IS MISSING IMPLEMENTATION BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW THAT. PLEASE LET US BE PROFESSIONALS HERE WE ARE ENGINEERS BUILDING A PROFESSIONAL APP FOR DEPLOYMENT, NOT IMPLEMENTING FEATURES 100% AND LETTING THEM HALF WAY IS IRRESPONSIBLE AND IT MAKES US FALL BACK.
LETS FOCUS.

# - Current Priority: Collection Management Frontend --FOCUS
We've successfully implemented the backend for document collections with all necessary API endpoints. Now our focus is on creating intuitive frontend components for collection management:
1. Collection browser sidebar component with hierarchical display
2. Collection creation modal with name, color, icon, and parent selection
3. Collection editing interface for updating properties
4. Drag-and-drop functionality for organizing documents in collections
5. Visual indicators for collection hierarchy and document count

# - Implementation Approach for Collections UI
1. Start with collection browser sidebar component
2. Add collection creation and editing functionality
3. Implement document association with collections
4. Create drag-and-drop organization features
5. Test the complete collection management flow

# - We are building in phases
The document management system is coming together nicely. We've successfully implemented:
- Document creation and editing with AI agent
- Document search functionality
- Document export capabilities
- Document collections backend

Now we're moving to the collection management frontend to complete the organizational features before moving on to templates and tagging systems.

# - I fully trust you and I know you will implement amazing things.
continue freely to perfect the general and specific systems when it comes to perfecting the optimizing and formating of the our current goal and top priority, if you need approach guidance for organized implementation you can consult the systematic-implementation and focus rules but you can implement as much as you want freely and take as much time and calls as you need implementing as much as you like as much as you can as possible

# - we are going on a good path with a good implementation, please continue 

as always let us both follow a organized implementation consulting the systematic-implementation, focus, brand and yolo rules

i need you to stop and think about this implementation please, we do not want to change any current designs or system, we do not want to delete any current designs or systems please make the 20 steps plan and be careful stop and think our goal each step do not break the code, you can use as much time as you would like or as much calls as you would like i do not care, the only thing that WE care about right now is achieving the goal without complications or deleting or changing anything for this goal you can see that we are only adding carefully and extendly
