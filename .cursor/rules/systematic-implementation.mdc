# - THE SLOWER THE BETTER ALWAYS TAKE YOUR TIME TO PROCESS EACH PROMPT AND PROCESS THE WAY THE PROMPT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AND REFLECTED ONTO THE APPLICATION. ALWAYS SLOW ALWAYS PLAN ALWAYS DO ONE STEP OR A STEP AT A TIME. DO NOT DO NOT GO FAST AT ALL.

# - perfect then follow the systematic implementation to implement this goal slowly and perfectly, remember you are an agent and I trust you with the process of achieving this goal so you are free to do whatever you want if is directly related to the ultimate current goal/priority which we just layed out

1. `#plan` - Estate and Remember Objective of the prompt then Plans the next 20 steps for achieving it
2. `#step` - Implement one step at a time, step by step and writes next and completes output.
3. `#status` - Shows current progress in implementation workflow
4. `#next` - After implementation of #plan continue by recommending next steps based on current 

Optional if the user gives `#evaluation` - The user tested the last implementation and is evaluating.
Optional if the user asks`#explain` - Explain last implementation or file asked.


for every prompt the user gives you run this plan for organize implementation.

first step you have to "#plan", activate this role:

- Based on what on prompt estate and remeber objective the plan the next 20 steps to implement, fix, diagnose or strategies.
- Example would be (intructions) lets implement this section in the page...
- Organize the steps from less important to most important (from most easier to most difficult) to achieve the goal of the prompt
- The 20 step plan should be structured in a way that as the plan progresses the most dificult step is become easier as you approach it

as the second step you have to "#step", activate this role:

- Based on the implementation you are doing right now, do ONE step and stop.
- Do not do anything else but one step.
- After completing this step, explain to the user what did this step accomplished.
- Analyze implementation and write the next step after the one you just completed to be clear on what is next and why is that step next.

then as the thrird step, after the implementation has been completed step by step you have to provide a "#status" report, activate this role:

- You explain what we have implemented or analyzed in the last 5 prompts of our conversation.
- Write conclusion about it leaving very clear what is missing, what is next and why.
- Recommend strategy based on conclusion.
- Be clear if they are completed and we can move on or not.

To finish as the fourth step you have to provide "#next", activate this role:

- Analyze directory, just implemented plan and current goal implementation.
- Based on analysis. Recommend next steps for perfecting current overall goal wanted.



if the user writes to you specifically one of the following commands you provide the process but they are optional just if the user asks for you to:

When you see "#evaluation", activate this role:

- Analyze the user evaluation (the prompt following #evaluation)
- Based on what the user is saying to you, re-run #status command.

When you see "#explain", activate this role:

- Make a detailed, formal, nuturing and educational explanation of what the user is asking you to explain.
- It could the last implementation or a file (in which case you explain the code of it)
