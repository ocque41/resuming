description: - `#step` - Implement one step and writes next and completes output. - `#status` - Shows current progress in implementation workflow - `#stack` - Remembers to not stack functions on one file - `#plan` - Plans next 5 steps - `#help` - Asks the user to take external action away from the code - `#analyze` - Based on implementation, what can we do now ? - `#evaluation` - The user tested the last implementation and is evaluating. - `#explain` - Explain last implementation or file asked. - '#next' - After implementation of #plan continue by recommending next steps based on current implementation  When you see "#step", activate this role:  - Based on the implementation you are doing right now, do ONE step and stop. - Do not do anything else but one step. - After completing this step, explain to the user what did this step accomplished. - Analyze implementation and write the next step after the one you just completed to be clear on what is next and why is that step next.  When you see "#status", activate this role:  - You explain what we have implemented or analyzed in the last 5 prompts of our conversation. - Write conclusion about it leaving very clear what is missing, what is next and why. - Recommend strategy based on conclusion. - Be clear if they are completed and we can move on or not.  When you see "#stack", activate this role:  - Remember that supabase has a max_stack_depth that is 2048KB. - Remember to not stack functions on one file because we will hit the max stack depth. - If necessary, recommend refractoring code and separating functions onto another file, beign specific on which functions and which files are necessary.  When you see "#plan", activate this role:  - Based on what the user ask, plan the next five steps to implement, fix, diagnose or strategies. - Usually the user will write #plan and then tell what to plan for. - Example would be #plan lets implement this section in the page...  When you see "#help", activate this role: THE USER IS ASKING IF YOU NEED HELP.  - Ask the user to do a thing related to current implementation outside of the code. - Nothing to do with the repo. - "EXAMPLES" could be, migrate this table, connect to supabase, create a bucket, " I do not know about this could you search information to complete implementation ", ETC....  When you see "#analyze", activate this role:  - Analyze the last #status report. - Make a check list on the things the user can test now based on #status.  When you see "#evaluation", activate this role:  - Analyze the user evaluation (the prompt following #evaluation) - Based on what the user is saying to you, re-run #status command.  When you see "#explain", activate this role:  - Make a detailed, formal, nuturing and educational explanation of what the user is asking you to explain. - It could the last implementation or a file (in which case you explain the code of it)  When you see "#next", activate this role:  - Analyze directory, just implemented plan and current goal implementation. - Based on analysis. Recommend next steps for perfecting current overall goal wanted.
globs:

1. `#plan` - Plans next 5 steps
2. `#step` - Implement one step and writes next and completes output.
3. `#status` - Shows current progress in implementation workflow
4. `#next` - After implementation of #plan continue by recommending next steps based on current 

Optional if the user gives `#evaluation` - The user tested the last implementation and is evaluating.
Optional if the user asks`#explain` - Explain last implementation or file asked.


for every prompt the user gives you run this plan for organize implementation.

first step you have to "#plan", activate this role:

- Based on what the user ask, plan the next five steps to implement, fix, diagnose or strategies.
- Usually the user will write #plan and then tell what to plan for.
- Example would be #plan lets implement this section in the page...

as the second step you have to "#step", activate this role:

- Based on the implementation you are doing right now, do ONE step and stop.
- Do not do anything else but one step.
- After completing this step, explain to the user what did this step accomplished.
- Analyze implementation and write the next step after the one you just completed to be clear on what is next and why is that step next.

then as the thrird step, after the implementation has been completed step by step you have to provide a "#status" report, activate this role:

- You explain what we have implemented or analyzed in the last 5 prompts of our conversation.
- Write conclusion about it leaving very clear what is missing, what is next and why.
- Recommend strategy based on conclusion.
- Be clear if they are completed and we can move on or not.

To finish as the fourth step you have to provide "#next", activate this role:

- Analyze directory, just implemented plan and current goal implementation.
- Based on analysis. Recommend next steps for perfecting current overall goal wanted.



if the user writes to you specifically one of the following commands you provide the process but they are optional just if the user asks for you to:

When you see "#evaluation", activate this role:

- Analyze the user evaluation (the prompt following #evaluation)
- Based on what the user is saying to you, re-run #status command.

When you see "#explain", activate this role:

- Make a detailed, formal, nuturing and educational explanation of what the user is asking you to explain.
- It could the last implementation or a file (in which case you explain the code of it)
