# OpenAI Agents SDK Documentation

When implementing the OpenAI Agents SDK, always consult these key resources:

## Core Concepts
- **Agents**: LLMs equipped with instructions, tools, and capabilities
- **Handoffs**: Allow agents to delegate tasks to other agents
- **Guardrails**: Enable validation of inputs to agents
- **Tracing**: Built-in functionality to visualize and debug agent flows

## Implementation Guides
- Install via `pip install openai-agents`
- Set OpenAI API key via environment variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Basic agent creation:
  ```python
  from agents import Agent, Runner
  
  agent = Agent(
    name="File Handler",
    instructions="You create and edit files based on user requests"
  )
  
  result = Runner.run_sync(agent, "Create a new JSON file")
  ```

## Tools Implementation
- Function tools: Turn Python functions into tools with automatic schema generation
- File manipulation tools should be carefully implemented with proper error handling
- Tools for document creation and editing need clear input validation

## Best Practices
- Create specialized agents for specific tasks
- Invest in good prompts that clearly define available tools and parameters
- Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Utilize tracing for debugging complex agent workflows
