# Introduction

Modern recruitment is a blend of sophisticated technology and human judgment. Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) have become nearly ubiquitous in hiring, especially among larger companies, to manage high volumes of applicants. Over 98% of Fortune 500 companies use an ATS to streamline hiring​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/8-things-you-need-to-know-about-applicant-tracking-systems/#:~:text=,focuses%20on%20building%20relationships%20with)

, and even many mid-sized and small firms employ ATS software (about 60% of large companies and 35% of small organizations)​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=Do%20all%20recruiters%20use%20ATS,systems)

​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=Do%20small%20companies%20use%20ATS%3F)

. These systems parse and store resumes in databases, enabling recruiters to filter candidates by keywords and qualifications. However, passing the ATS scan is only the first hurdle – human recruiters in HR departments ultimately review shortlisted resumes and make decisions. This report provides a deep, technical, industry-wide analysis of how ATS algorithms work and how HR professionals evaluate candidates. We will explore ATS functionality, keyword optimization strategies, HR decision criteria, differences across industries and regions, and how hiring practices vary from tech giants to financial firms and startups. Actionable tips are included to help job seekers optimize their resumes for both ATS and human readers.

## 1\. ATS Functionality & Algorithms

**Resume Parsing and Data Extraction:** Modern ATS software automatically **parses** incoming resumes, converting the raw document into structured data. When an application is submitted (typically as a Word or PDF file), the ATS will scan the resume’s text to identify sections (education, experience, skills, etc.), then populate corresponding fields in a candidate profile​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=After%20presenting%20you%20with%20knockout,it%20into%20a%20structured%20format)

. Key details like name, contact info, job titles, company names, dates, and skills are extracted. If the resume is poorly formatted or uses unusual layouts, parsing can fail – for example, resumes with content in headers/footers or text embedded in images may not be read by the ATS​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-formatting-mistakes/#:~:text=Job%20seekers%20sometimes%20put%20additional,footer%29%20of%20their%20resume)

​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-formatting-mistakes/#:~:text=Using%20headers%20and%20footers%20can,main%20body%20of%20the%20resume)

. Greenhouse (a popular ATS) notes that resumes can fail to parse if the file is too large (often due to high-resolution graphics), if the resume contains “fake” placeholder data, or if the formatting is overly complex​

[support.greenhouse.io](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/200989175-Unsuccessful-resume-parse#:~:text=,Resume%20formatting%20issues)

​

[support.greenhouse.io](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/200989175-Unsuccessful-resume-parse#:~:text=)

. Simple, **ATS-friendly formatting** helps ensure all information is captured. This means using standard section headings (“Work Experience”, “Education”, etc.), a clean layout without text boxes or columns that confuse reading order, and avoiding graphs or logos​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-formatting-mistakes/#:~:text=6)

​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-formatting-mistakes/#:~:text=,instead%20of%20%E2%80%9CSummary%E2%80%9D%20or%20%E2%80%9CObjective%E2%80%9D)

.

**Keyword Indexing and Search:** Once parsed, the resume’s text is stored in a **database** that recruiters and hiring managers can query. ATS allows searching by keywords – which can be single words or phrases – to find candidates whose resumes match the job requirements​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=Hiring%20managers%20use%20keywords%20to,are%20job%20titles%20or%20skills)

. Recruiters typically input a set of **required keywords** (skills, job titles, certifications) and sometimes optional keywords. For example, an ATS search for a “PHP Developer” role might mark **“PHP”** as required and other terms like “C++”, “Java”, or “Photoshop” as optional​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=Below%20is%20what%20the%20search,skills%2C%20although%20they%20aren%E2%80%99t%20required)

. Only resumes containing the required keyword will show up in results​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=When%20the%20hiring%20manager%20hits,the%20keyword%20%E2%80%9CPHP%E2%80%9D%20will%20appear)

. If a resume lacks a critical keyword (e.g. the exact programming language or job title), it may remain *hidden* in the database, effectively a black hole​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=might%20be%20combined%20with%20%E2%80%9CX,%E2%80%9D)

​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=This%20is%20why%20it%E2%80%99s%20crucial,the%20job%20you%E2%80%99re%20applying%20to)

. This is why many qualified candidates are never seen – one Harvard Business School study found that 88% of employers believe qualified applicants get filtered out by ATS for not having the right keywords​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/top-resume-keywords-boost-resume/#:~:text=database%2C%20never%20to%20be%20seen,didn%E2%80%99t%20contain%20the%20right%20keywords)

. The screenshot below shows an example ATS search interface where a recruiter has set “PHP” as a required skill and others as optional:

*Example of an ATS search filter interface (Bullhorn ATS). Recruiters can specify required and optional keywords, and only resumes containing the required terms (e.g. “PHP”) will be retrieved​*

*.*

**Ranking and Scoring Mechanisms:** In addition to basic querying, some ATS algorithms can **rank** or **score** resumes based on their relevance to a job posting. For instance, Oracle Taleo (used by many large companies) computes a “Req Rank” – a percentage match score between the resume and job description​

[thetechresume.com](https://thetechresume.com/samples/ats-myths-busted#:~:text=The%20only%20popular%20ATS%20that,and%20which%20to%20pass%20on)

. This score considers keyword matches (including frequency and context), answers to application questions, and other criteria​

[thetechresume.com](https://thetechresume.com/samples/ats-myths-busted#:~:text=The%20only%20popular%20ATS%20that,and%20which%20to%20pass%20on)

. A higher score indicates the candidate is a closer fit. In Taleo, recruiters can sort applicants by this rank to prioritize review​

[thetechresume.com](https://thetechresume.com/samples/ats-myths-busted#:~:text=The%20only%20popular%20ATS%20that,and%20which%20to%20pass%20on)

. However, it’s worth noting that such automated scoring is not universal across ATS platforms – Taleo is one of the few popular systems with a built-in ranking algorithm​

[thetechresume.com](https://thetechresume.com/samples/ats-myths-busted#:~:text=The%20only%20popular%20ATS%20that,and%20which%20to%20pass%20on)

. Many modern ATS (Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, etc.) do **not automatically reject or “pass” resumes** purely by algorithm; instead, they serve as search and organization tools for recruiters​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/8-things-you-need-to-know-about-applicant-tracking-systems/#:~:text=ATS%20AND%20ITS%20AI%20FEATURES,THE%20NEED%20FOR%20HUMAN%20REVIEW)

. Recruiters often still scan through applications manually (usually sorted by date or keyword relevance) because they don’t want to miss a good candidate due to rigid filters​

[thetechresume.com](https://thetechresume.com/samples/ats-myths-busted#:~:text=Tech%20recruiters%20would%20not%20trust,recruiter%20for%20over%2020%20years)

. In practice, an ATS is a helper tool – it **streamlines** resume screening but doesn’t make final decisions​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/8-things-you-need-to-know-about-applicant-tracking-systems/#:~:text=ATS%20AND%20ITS%20AI%20FEATURES,THE%20NEED%20FOR%20HUMAN%20REVIEW)

. Resumes that pass initial ATS filtering are forwarded to human recruiters for evaluation​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/8-things-you-need-to-know-about-applicant-tracking-systems/#:~:text=ATS%20AND%20ITS%20AI%20FEATURES,THE%20NEED%20FOR%20HUMAN%20REVIEW)

.

**Common ATS Rejection Factors:** While ATS software itself *doesn’t “reject” candidates* outright on a whim, certain factors can prevent a resume from ever being seen by a human. These include:

- **Knockout Questions:** Many online applications begin with yes/no or short-answer questions about basic qualifications (e.g. “Do you have the required certification?,” “Are you willing to relocate?”). These are knockout questions, and unsatisfactory answers will flag or auto-reject the application in the ATS​

  [jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=But%20first%20you%20might%20see,some%20knockout%20questions)

  ​

  [jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=Knockout%20questions%20can%20be%20in,automatically%20rejected%20by%20the%20ATS)

  . For example, answering “No” to a must-have like a work authorization or a required years of experience can automatically disqualify the candidate​

  [jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=Examples%20of%20knock)

  . This helps employers filter out candidates who don’t meet non-negotiable criteria early on.

- **Parsing Errors:** If a resume’s content can’t be parsed, it may be stored as an image or attachment without searchable text. Recruiters might not manually read unparsed resumes due to time constraints. Causes of parsing failure include resumes saved in incompatible formats (e.g. a scanned image PDF instead of text-based PDF), excessive file size (often from graphics – Greenhouse ATS fails to parse files &gt;2.5MB​

  [support.greenhouse.io](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/200989175-Unsuccessful-resume-parse#:~:text=,too%20large)

  ), use of non-standard fonts or symbols, or text placed in headers/footers that the ATS ignores​

  [jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-formatting-mistakes/#:~:text=Job%20seekers%20sometimes%20put%20additional,footer%29%20of%20their%20resume)

  . For instance, putting your name and page number in a header can result in the ATS not “seeing” that text​

  . It’s recommended to include name and contact info in the main body of the first page, and if using a second page, put “Name – Page 2” in the header so that it doesn’t confuse the parser​

  [careerservices.uic.edu](https://careerservices.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2017/08/Ensure-Your-Resume-Is-Read-ATS.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Do%20feel%20free%20to,Include%20that%20information%20on%20a)

  .

- **Missing Keywords or Criteria:** As mentioned, if the job posting or recruiter search expects certain keywords and they’re absent, the resume might never surface. For example, a resume that says “Managed retail team” might be overlooked if the recruiter searches for “store supervisor” instead. In one example, a candidate proficient in Adobe’s design software had listed “Adobe Creative *Cloud*” on their resume, but the job description used the older term “Adobe Creative *Suite*.” An ATS search for “Creative Suite” would miss that candidate​

  [jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/top-resume-keywords-boost-resume/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20if%20you%E2%80%99re%20a,standards%20like%20Photoshop%20and%20Illustrator)

  ​

  [jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/top-resume-keywords-boost-resume/#:~:text=But%20let%E2%80%99s%20say%20the%20job,Creative%20Suite%2C%E2%80%9D%20its%20former%20name)

  . This illustrates how crucial it is to mirror the employer’s wording (we discuss optimization strategies in Section 2).

- **Formatting Issues and Unreadable Content:** Unusual formatting can lead to content not being indexed. For instance, using a decorative font or multiple column layouts might scramble the text order. ATS guidelines advise using simple, common fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman, etc.) and keeping font size readable (10–12pt)​

  [jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-formatting-mistakes/#:~:text=Once%20again%2C%20this%20mistake%20occurs,Remember%2C%20keep%20it%20simple)

  ​

  [jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-formatting-mistakes/#:~:text=These%20fonts%20are%20legible%2C%20widely,compatible%20with%20most%20ATS%20software)

  . Avoiding tables or split columns is generally wise, as some ATS read left-to-right across columns (mixing content) unless templates are specially tested. Similarly, avoid inserting important keywords as part of an image or graphic (text in images is invisible to ATS unless the system has OCR, which most standard ATS do not for resumes).

- **Excessive Length or Irrelevant Data:** While an ATS won’t explicitly reject a long resume (there’s **no length penalty in ATS algorithms**​

  [careerservices.uic.edu](https://careerservices.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2017/08/Ensure-Your-Resume-Is-Read-ATS.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Do%20feel%20free%20to,Include%20that%20information%20on%20a)

  ), extremely long resumes could dilute keyword density or include irrelevant info that confuses the parser. Most recruiters still prefer resumes around 1–2 pages for professional roles, balancing detail with conciseness. In fact, one analysis found **resumes between 475 and 600 words perform best**, whereas resumes that were very short or overly long had lower chances of getting interviews​

  [flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=%2A%20In%20fact%2C%2036,6)

  ​

  [flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=%2A%2077,6)

  . It’s okay to have a two-page resume (especially for 10+ years experience), and data suggests recruiters actually favor two-page resumes for experienced candidates – in a study, two-page resumes were 2.3 times more preferred and scored 21% higher on average than one-page resumes​

  [flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=%2A%20Approximately%2063,page)

  ​

  [flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=%2A%20Two,resume%20inappropriate%20for%20an%20experienced)

  . The key is to ensure everything included is relevant and well-organized, so the ATS (and later the human reader) finds the most pertinent information quickly.

**ATS Platforms and Differences:** There are dozens of ATS platforms on the market, each with unique features. Common systems include **Oracle Taleo** (often used by large enterprises and known for its robust filtering and scoring features), **Workday** (an ATS integrated into the popular Workday HR suite, used by many Fortune 500 firms), **iCIMS** and **SAP SuccessFactors** (enterprise-grade ATS with extensive customization), **Greenhouse** and **Lever** (popular with tech companies and startups for their modern interface and integrations), **Jobvite**, **BrassRing (Kenexa)**, **Bullhorn** (common in staffing agencies), and many more. Despite differences, the core functionality – storing applicant data, keyword search, workflow tracking – is similar. Where they may differ is in UI and extra features: e.g. Workday’s ATS module ties into HRIS data; Greenhouse emphasizes collaboration with hiring managers; Bullhorn is tailored to recruiter agencies and has strong CRM capabilities. Some older systems like Taleo introduced early automated ranking (the “Req Rank” discussed above)​

[thetechresume.com](https://thetechresume.com/samples/ats-myths-busted#:~:text=The%20only%20popular%20ATS%20that,and%20which%20to%20pass%20on)

, whereas newer systems focus on ease of use and integration (and may rely on the recruiter’s judgment more than automation). **Nearly all ATS can integrate some level of AI** or advanced filtering now – surveys show about 79% of organizations have integrated AI or automation into their ATS in some form​

[selectsoftwarereviews.com](https://www.selectsoftwarereviews.com/blog/applicant-tracking-system-statistics#:~:text=Applicant%20Tracking%20System%20Statistics%20,automation%20to%20filter%20out)

. For example, an ATS might use AI to automatically screen out obviously unqualified applicants (those 88% of applicants who don’t meet basic criteria, as one study found​

[selectsoftwarereviews.com](https://www.selectsoftwarereviews.com/blog/applicant-tracking-system-statistics#:~:text=In%20many%20cases%2C%20much%20of,squarely%20on%20the%20company%E2%80%99s%20ATS)

​

[selectsoftwarereviews.com](https://www.selectsoftwarereviews.com/blog/applicant-tracking-system-statistics#:~:text=,reduction%20in%20cost%20per%20screen)

) or to recommend top matches to a recruiter. Nonetheless, savvy HR teams configure their ATS with care – they know it’s a tool to *assist* in decision-making, not replace it. As one long-time recruiter put it, “No recruiter I know would trust an ATS with filtering \[entirely\]… the risk \[of missing a good candidate\] is too high.”​

[thetechresume.com](https://thetechresume.com/samples/ats-myths-busted#:~:text=Tech%20recruiters%20would%20not%20trust,recruiter%20for%20over%2020%20years)

**Multi-Page Resumes and ATS:** A frequent concern is whether a two-page resume will be parsed fully by an ATS. The answer is yes – ATS will parse all pages of a document as long as the format is standard. There is no automatic rejection for length​

[careerservices.uic.edu](https://careerservices.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2017/08/Ensure-Your-Resume-Is-Read-ATS.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Do%20feel%20free%20to,Include%20that%20information%20on%20a)

. However, candidates should include identifying info (name, email or a header) on page 2 just in case pages get separated. As mentioned, putting “Page 2” in a header with your name can be a tactic so that the ATS doesn’t read “Page 2” as unrelated text in the middle of your experience​

[careerservices.uic.edu](https://careerservices.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2017/08/Ensure-Your-Resume-Is-Read-ATS.pdf#:~:text=length,the%20ATS%20can%E2%80%99t%20%E2%80%9Csee%E2%80%9D%20it)

. Also, avoid duplicating content between pages as some ATS might flag it strangely. In summary, focus on quality of content over page count – it’s better to have a two-page resume with all critical keywords and achievements than to cut to one page and lose important terms that the ATS (or recruiter) needs to see.

**Beyond Screening – ATS Functions:** It’s worth noting that ATS are more than just resume scanners. They function as end-to-end recruitment platforms. Many ATS handle interview scheduling, emailing candidates, and tracking the status of each applicant through the hiring pipeline​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/8-things-you-need-to-know-about-applicant-tracking-systems/#:~:text=Here%20are%20some%20of%20the,other%20things%20an%20ATS%20does)

. They can automatically send confirmation emails or rejection notes, collate feedback from interviewers, and generate hiring metrics reports (time-to-fill, source of hire, etc.)​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/8-things-you-need-to-know-about-applicant-tracking-systems/#:~:text=Here%20are%20some%20of%20the,other%20things%20an%20ATS%20does)

. Modern ATS often blur the line with CRM (Candidate Relationship Management) systems, which manage talent pools and keep in touch with passive candidates. For example, an ATS may save all parsed resumes, allowing recruiters to search the database later to “rediscover” past applicants when new roles open​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=ATS%20go%20beyond%20simple%20applicant,ATS%20was%20probably%20behind%20it)

. If you ever get contacted months after applying, it might be because a recruiter searched the ATS for a keyword and your old application popped up​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=ATS%20go%20beyond%20simple%20applicant,ATS%20was%20probably%20behind%20it)

. In short, ATS technology underpins a lot of the hiring operations behind the scenes, enabling consistency and efficiency at scale. Knowing this, job seekers should approach ATS as both a gatekeeper (to optimize for) and a filing system (to be mindful that anything submitted might be retrievable in the future).

## 2\. Keyword Analysis & Optimization

One of the most critical factors in ATS screening is **keyword matching**. Recruiters configure ATS searches or filters based on the job description – typically focusing on job titles, technical skills, and specific qualifications. “The first thing I’m looking for is the hard skills that match the job description,” one corporate recruiter explained when discussing how they search through an ATS​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/top-resume-keywords-boost-resume/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20first%20thing%20I%E2%80%99m%20looking,one%20corporate%20recruiter%20told%20Jobscan)

. In practice, this means if a job posting requires experience with **Python and SQL**, the recruiter will likely search the ATS database for “Python” and “SQL” (possibly both as required keywords). Resumes lacking those terms would be ignored by the system​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=Hiring%20managers%20can%20also%20type,ray%20certification%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9Cpatient%20care.%E2%80%9D)

. Therefore, **keyword optimization** is about ensuring your resume speaks the same language as the job description.

**Hard Skills vs. Soft Skills:** Most ATS keyword searches revolve around **hard skills** – the tangible qualifications and tools required for the job (e.g. programming languages, software tools, certifications, methodologies). These are straightforward for an algorithm to match. **Soft skills** (like leadership, teamwork, communication) are also valued by employers but are less commonly used as strict ATS search filters. It’s unlikely a recruiter types “communication skills” into an ATS search bar, because nearly every resume claims those. Instead, soft skills are assessed later during human review or interviews. That said, many job descriptions list soft skills, and including them (especially if phrased the same way) can’t hurt – some ATS *scoring* algorithms might give a more holistic match score including soft skill keywords. Indeed, 91% of employers say that they value resumes that **emphasize soft skills** alongside hard skills​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=greeting%20on%20their%20cover%20letters,resumes%20that%20emphasize%20soft%20skills)

. The key is balance: ensure all the *must-have hard skills* for the role are present in your resume, and sprinkle the relevant soft skills in context (e.g. in describing a leadership achievement or a team project) rather than as a bland list.

**Top Keywords Across Industries:** The specific keywords that matter vary by industry and role. A data analysis by Jobscan of millions of job descriptions identified the top 500 keywords employers search for, organized by category​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/top-resume-keywords-boost-resume/#:~:text=Job%20seekers%2C%20rejoice%21%20We%E2%80%99ve%20compiled,for%20when%20considering%20job%20applicants)

​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/top-resume-keywords-boost-resume/#:~:text=When%20you%20submit%20your%20resume%2C,%E2%80%9D)

. Common **general** resume keywords include things like *project management*, *communication*, *leadership*, *managed*, *improved*, etc., which appear across many fields. But more telling are industry-specific terms. For example:

- **Tech Industry:** Keywords like programming languages (Python, Java, C++, JavaScript), frameworks (React, Angular, Node.js), cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), and methodologies (Agile, DevOps) are frequent for software roles. In the “Information Technology/Computer Science” category of the Jobscan study, terms such as “.NET”, “AWS”, “C#”, “SQL”, “Linux”, “machine learning”, “Git”, “Cloud”, “JavaScript”, “quality assurance”, “UI/UX”, etc. featured prominently​

  [jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/top-resume-keywords-boost-resume/#:~:text=,business%20analysis)

  ​

  [jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/top-resume-keywords-boost-resume/#:~:text=,routing)

  . A software engineer’s resume without specific technologies listed is unlikely to rank well.

- **Finance and Business:** Common keywords include financial terms and certifications: *financial analysis*, *accounting*, *budgeting*, *FP&A*, *ROI*, *CPA* (Certified Public Accountant), *audit*, *compliance*, *investment*, etc. For instance, under “Business, Finance, Law” the frequent terms were things like “accounting”, “financial management”, “risk management”, “analysis”, “regulatory”, “tax”​

  [jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/top-resume-keywords-boost-resume/#:~:text=Business%2C%20Finance%2C%20Law)

  ​

  [jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/top-resume-keywords-boost-resume/#:~:text=,financial%20performance)

  . Financial firms also value Excel and data skills (e.g. “Excel modeling”, “SQL”) and credentials like “MBA” or “CFA” depending on the role.

- **Marketing and Media:** Here keywords bifurcate into creative and analytical: terms like *branding*, *SEO*, *content strategy*, *Google Analytics*, *social media marketing*, *campaign*, *ROI*, *Adobe Creative Suite* are often sought. A marketing manager’s resume might need keywords such as “SEO”, “social media”, “CRM”, “content creation”, “lead generation”, etc., which signal both creative ability and data-driven marketing. In job descriptions, you often see soft skills like “collaboration” or “creativity” too; including those can help but again, tangible skills like “SEO” or “Google Ads” are usually the primary filters.

- **Healthcare and Medicine:** Keywords focus on licenses, specializations, and compliance: *RN* (Registered Nurse), *NCLEX*, *patient care*, *HIPAA*, *EMR/EHR* (Electronic Medical Records systems), *clinic management*, *diagnostic*, *acute care*, etc. For a nursing position, an ATS might scan for “RN” or “B.S.N.” (Bachelor of Science in Nursing), specific unit experience (e.g. “ICU”, “pediatrics”), and certifications like “ACLS” (Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support). Healthcare resumes should absolutely include relevant credentials by name, as these are often used as mandatory keywords.

- **AI and Data Science:** In the AI/ML field, important keywords include programming languages (Python, R, Java), libraries/frameworks (*TensorFlow*, *PyTorch*), concepts (*machine learning*, *deep learning*, *NLP*), and mathematics (*statistics*, *data analysis*). If you’re applying for an AI specialist role, including project-specific keywords like “predictive modeling”, “neural networks”, “computer vision”, and relevant publications or research can be crucial. Many AI roles are in tech companies, so the same ATS practices for tech apply, but there might be more emphasis on advanced degrees (MSc, PhD) as keywords and research keywords (like “IEEE”, “research paper”, etc., if relevant to the role).

In all cases, *mirror the language of the job posting*. A strong indicator of which keywords to use is the job description itself: identify the nouns and phrases that repeat or stand out. For example, if a posting for a project manager mentions “stakeholder management” and “Agile/Scrum” explicitly, those exact phrases should appear on your resume if you have that experience. If you only say “led projects” without mentioning Agile or stakeholders, you might be overlooked. Indeed, one study found that on average candidates’ resumes contained only about **51% of the keywords** that appeared in the job description​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=,13)

​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=,13)

 – meaning many applicants miss half the terms the employer considers important. Don’t leave those matches to chance.

**Keyword Placement and Frequency:** It’s not only about *having* the keyword, but also using it in a meaningful context. ATS algorithms count keyword frequency and may analyze the context (the best ones use basic NLP to understand where on the resume the term appears – e.g. in job titles, in descriptions, etc.). Make sure critical skills are listed prominently – ideally in a **skills section** or summary and then reinforced under work experience. For example, if “data analysis” is key, you might list it under a Skills/Competencies section *and* mention in a job bullet “Performed data analysis using SQL and Excel to \[achieve X\].” Repetition (to a sensible degree) can improve keyword density and confidence that you truly have the skill. However, avoid **keyword stuffing** – i.e. listing a barrage of keywords out of context or, worse, adding invisible white-text keywords. Recruiters are aware of such tricks and it can backfire. Only include keywords for skills you actually possess and try to demonstrate them with an achievement or result when possible​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=In%20this%20example%2C%20you%20can,likely%20to%20get%20an%20interview)

​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=If%20they%E2%80%99re%20not%2C%20you%E2%80%99re%20far,likely%20to%20get%20an%20interview)

. As Jobscan advises, “only add keywords if they accurately reflect your expertise… If they don’t, it’s called keyword stuffing (or lying!) and you’ll be found out eventually.”​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=In%20this%20example%2C%20you%20can,likely%20to%20get%20an%20interview)

​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=If%20they%E2%80%99re%20not%2C%20you%E2%80%99re%20far,likely%20to%20get%20an%20interview)

. In other words, integrate keywords honestly.

**Synonyms and Variations:** One trap candidates fall into is using a different term than the employer uses. We saw the *Adobe Creative Cloud* vs *Creative Suite* example above. Another common scenario is spelling out or abbreviating differently. For instance, the job might list “CPA” but your resume only says “Certified Public Accountant,” or vice versa. It’s best to include **both versions** if possible: e.g. “Certified Public Accountant (CPA)” in the text covers both keyword variants​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-formatting-mistakes/#:~:text=While%20it%20may%20seem%20obvious,so%20obvious%20to%20an%20ATS)

​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-formatting-mistakes/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20if%20a%20hiring,to%20skip%20over%20your%20resume)

. Similarly, include both the acronym and full name for technical terms and certifications (write “Search Engine Optimization (SEO)” once, then you can just use “SEO” thereafter). This ensures whichever term the recruiter searches, your resume hits. Also, different companies use different titles for similar roles – if you were a “Software Ninja” (creative title) at a startup but applying to a “Software Engineer” opening, it’s wise to list your title as “Software Engineer” (perhaps in parentheses or as a straight title) rather than an unconventional term. As a rule, **use the standard titles** found in your target job descriptions. If your past title was “Customer Service Wizard,” consider converting it to a more ATS-friendly equivalent like “Customer Service Representative” on your resume​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/top-resume-keywords-boost-resume/#:~:text=titles%20based%20on%20industry%2C%20company,culture%2C%20or%20experience%20levels)

​

. The ATS isn’t going to intuit a quirky title, and recruiters search by conventional titles. Aligning terminology can significantly improve your chances of being found.

**Most Searched Skills by Recruiters:** Recruiter surveys indicate that certain skill keywords are almost universally attractive. For example, LinkedIn data often shows skills like “communication,” “problem-solving,” “leadership,” “project management,” “Salesforce,” “Excel,” and “Python” ranking highly in many job ads or profiles. In 2025, Jobscan’s analysis found terms like “project management” and “budgeting” common in business roles, “SEO” and “content” in marketing, various programming languages in IT, and so on​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/top-resume-keywords-boost-resume/#:~:text=,business%20analysis)

​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/top-resume-keywords-boost-resume/#:~:text=,routing)

. Another study by ResumeWorded aggregated job listings and found that **communication skills** and **leadership** are among the top soft skills sought, while **analytical skills**, **Microsoft Office proficiency**, and **management** appear as top hard skills in many fields. The takeaway for job seekers is to identify the *critical few* skills for your target job and ensure those exact phrases appear early and often in your resume. Some tools (like Jobscan’s resume scanner) even provide a “skills match” score, telling you which keywords from the job posting are missing from your resume​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=To%20increase%20your%20score%2C%20read,keywords%20that%20are%20hard%20skills)

​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=Hard%20skills%20are%20specific%20abilities,project%20management%2C%20Python%2C%20and%20SEO)

. Utilizing such tools can be an effective way to double-check your keyword alignment.

**Resume SEO vs. Readability:** Optimizing for ATS keywords should not come at the expense of human readability. The goal is to integrate keywords naturally into strong, descriptive sentences about your accomplishments. You do not want a keyword section that just lists every buzzword (e.g. “Skills: teamwork, communication, creativity, leadership, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, problem-solving, decision-making…” in a giant block). Such a list might get parsed, but when a human recruiter sees it, it looks like fluff. Instead, incorporate important skills into your **work experience bullets** where you can show context. For example: rather than just listing “Project Management – Agile – Scrum,” write a bullet like “Managed a 8-person team using Agile/Scrum methodologies to deliver a software project 2 weeks ahead of schedule.” This way you hit “Agile” and “Scrum” keywords while also demonstrating an achievement (ahead of schedule delivery). The resume that balances keyword content with compelling evidence of ability will perform best – it gets through the ATS and impresses the human reviewer.

**Avoiding Keyword Mistakes:** A few pitfalls to avoid: (1) **Using the wrong form of a keyword.** If a job is for a “Marketing Manager” and your resume objective says “seeking a manager position in marketing,” it might behoove you to actually use the title “Marketing Manager” somewhere (if appropriate to your experience), because some ATS ranking algorithms might prioritize an exact title match​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/8-things-you-need-to-know-about-applicant-tracking-systems/#:~:text=%2A%20Over%2098,Tools%20like)

. Also, ensure spelling matches (e.g. US vs UK spelling could matter if the job description uses one – “analyser” vs “analyzer”; usually not a huge issue, but be mindful). (2) **Overloading one section** – don’t hide 50 keywords in a paragraph in white text or a tiny font – older ATS might not notice, but newer ones or recruiters will (plus, some ATS flag resumes with a **suspiciously high keyword density** as possibly doctored). (3) **Neglecting alternate names:** As mentioned, include both acronym and full name. Another example: if you list “MBA” you might somewhere spell out “Master of Business Administration,” especially if the job description spells it out. If you list a programming skill like “C#,” consider also having “C# (.NET)” or similar to cover related terms. (4) **Context for soft skills:** Instead of just saying “strong communication skills” in a summary, tie it to a result: e.g. “Leveraged communication skills to mediate client-vendor disputes, improving retention by 15%.” This not only hits “communication” but also shows a quantifiable outcome, which humans love (and ATS would pick up “retention” and the percentage as nice bonus data).

In summary, treat your resume like a **targeted SEO project** where the “search engine” is the ATS and the “user” is the recruiter. Use the exact keywords that the “search query” (job description) demands, place them in important sections, and back them up with evidence. By doing so, you increase the chances that the ATS ranks you as a top match *and* the HR reviewer sees the value you can bring.

## 3\. HR Department Priorities & Decision-Making

After the ATS has done its initial filtering, your resume still needs to impress human eyes. HR professionals (recruiters, talent acquisition specialists, hiring managers, etc.) typically perform a **quick screening** of resumes to decide who moves forward. Studies have famously shown that recruiters spend mere seconds on an initial scan of a resume. In a well-known 2018 eye-tracking study by Ladders Inc., recruiters were found to spend just about **7.4 seconds on average** skimming each resume in the first pass​

[hrdive.com](https://www.hrdive.com/news/eye-tracking-study-shows-recruiters-look-at-resumes-for-7-seconds/541582/#:~:text=%2A%20In%20its%202018%20Eye,bold%20titles%20and%20bulleted%20accomplishments)

. (This was up slightly from 6 seconds in their 2012 study – so not much improvement in attention span.) In that blink of an eye, **what are they looking for?**

**Key Elements HR Checks in Seconds:** Recruiters tend to follow an “F-pattern” or “E-pattern” when glancing at a resume – focusing across the top and down the left side. They zero in on:

- **Current and Recent Job Titles/Companies:** They want to quickly see “Where does this person work now (or most recently) and what do they do?” If your current title matches or is very relevant to the position applied for, that’s an instant positive signal. For example, if a resume’s latest experience line says “**Software Engineer – XYZ Tech** (2019–Present)”, and you applied for a software engineer role, the recruiter immediately notes you have relevant current experience. If the title is unrelated, they may move on quickly. Thus, making sure your **top experience entry** is highly pertinent (or labeled in a pertinent way) is crucial. Some experts suggest using a brief **headline or summary** at the top of your resume to frame yourself (“Digital Marketing Specialist with 5 years in E-commerce”) to immediately align with the role – this can grab HR’s attention in those first seconds.

- **Tenure and Experience Level:** Recruiters scan dates to see how much experience you have and stability. If the job posting requires, say, 5-7 years of experience, and your resume shows about that (they might quickly add up your recent roles’ durations or note when you graduated), that’s good. They also check for any glaring employment gaps or extremely short stints. A series of very short jobs might be a red flag unless explained (and often ATS applications ask for reason for leaving, etc., which HR may review). In the 7-second scan, they might not catch all dates, but they see, for example, that you’ve been in your current job 2 years and previous one 3 years, etc., which indicates stability.

- **Education and Certifications:** Depending on the role, education can be a quick screen factor. HR might quickly note your degree and school (especially for entry-level roles or fields like finance or consulting where pedigree can matter). If a job requires a specific certification or license (CPA, PMP, RN, etc.), they’ll also be looking for that keyword or acronym on the resume. Typically, this is a quick check – if missing a required credential, the resume might be set aside. That’s why listing your relevant certifications prominently (preferably right under your name or in a summary or in a dedicated section) is important for roles that demand them.

- **Notable Achievements or Metrics:** Even in a short glance, **numbers jump out**. Recruiters have an eye for metrics on a resume – things like revenue numbers, percentages of improvement, size of teams led, etc. These give a concrete sense of scale and impact. For example, a bullet that says “Increased sales by 20% QoQ, generating $500K additional revenue” will catch a seasoned recruiter’s attention more than a generic “Improved sales performance.” Achievements framed with **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)** or results help HR see your potential value. One recruiter quoted by Resume Pilots put it succinctly: “I want to see hard results and achievements… Not just in words, but more importantly, in numbers.”​

  . Quantified accomplishments provide credibility and differentiate you. HR screeners often favor resumes that demonstrate **tangible impact** – e.g. cost savings, efficiency gains, growth metrics, customer satisfaction scores, awards won, etc.

- **Overall Presentation and Clarity:** The layout and readability of the resume heavily influence that quick scan. Recruiters prefer **simple, clean formatting with clear sections**​

  [hrdive.com](https://www.hrdive.com/news/eye-tracking-study-shows-recruiters-look-at-resumes-for-7-seconds/541582/#:~:text=seconds.%20,the%20eye%20down%20the%20page)

  . In the eye-tracking study, resumes with a clear visual hierarchy (section headings like Work Experience, Education, Skills), bullet points (vs. long paragraphs), and a good balance of white space were far more effective in holding attention​

  [hrdive.com](https://www.hrdive.com/news/eye-tracking-study-shows-recruiters-look-at-resumes-for-7-seconds/541582/#:~:text=seconds.%20,the%20eye%20down%20the%20page)

  . Cluttered or dense resumes, multiple columns, tiny fonts, or lack of obvious section breaks caused recruiters to lose interest or miss key info​

  [hrdive.com](https://www.hrdive.com/news/eye-tracking-study-shows-recruiters-look-at-resumes-for-7-seconds/541582/#:~:text=layouts%2C%20with%20clear%20sections%20and,the%20eye%20down%20the%20page)

  . So, from HR’s perspective, formatting is not just aesthetic – it directly affects how much info they can glean quickly. A well-organized resume allows a recruiter to *find* your qualifications in seconds (like job titles, skills, results as mentioned). If they have to hunt for basics (say your education is not where they expect, or dates aren’t aligned), it creates friction. This is why standard reverse-chronological format and clear headings are recommended. Even the presence of a skills summary can help – recruiters might scan that list to see if you have some required hard skills.

**Depth of Review:** If a resume passes the initial 6–10 second scan (i.e., nothing major disqualifying and it seems relevant), a recruiter will then read more in-depth, possibly spending a minute or two going through the content more carefully. In contrast to the “6 second rule,” other research using recruiters in a controlled setting found that when presented with qualified resumes, recruiters spent *several minutes* reviewing them. One study by a talent analytics group found recruiters spend on average **2 minutes, 24 seconds on one-page resumes and 4 minutes, 5 seconds on two-page resumes** that they deem worth reading​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=%2A%20Two,resume%20inappropriate%20for%20an%20experienced)

​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=,page%20resumes%20range)

. So, the initial screening is brief, but if you make that cut, your resume *will* be read more thoroughly. That’s when all the effort in crafting strong bullet points and details pays off.

**HR’s Evaluation Criteria:** In those more thorough reads and subsequent decision-making, HR professionals typically evaluate resumes on criteria such as:

- **Relevance of Experience:** How closely does the candidate’s past work align with the current role’s responsibilities? This includes not only having the right keywords (as ATS ensured) but the nature of projects and scope. For instance, if hiring for a project manager to run large client implementations, a candidate who has “Managed 5 end-to-end software implementation projects for enterprise clients (budgets $2M+)” will stand out. Recruiters often create a **shortlist** to present to the hiring manager, and they will pick those that best fit the job’s requirements and the team’s needs. Many keep an eye out for experience at well-regarded companies too, as a proxy for quality (fair or not, it happens).

- **Achievements and Performance Indicators:** As noted, resumes highlighting achievements (especially quantifiable ones) tend to be rated higher. HR likes to see evidence of high performance, such as promotions (which show growth), awards, exceeding targets, solving problems, etc. If two candidates both have 5 years experience, but one lists “led team of 10 to deliver XYZ, improving Y metric by 30%” and the other lists job duties without outcomes, the former will usually be viewed as stronger. Emphasizing **achievements over duties** is a known best practice, and HR actively looks for those who did something extra or delivered results, not just “was present doing tasks.” In fact, only about 26% of resumes include five or more measurable metrics​

  [flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=%2A%20Candidates%27%20resumes%20contained%2060,13)

  , and a sizable 36% of resumes had *zero* metrics​

  [flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=role.%5E%7B13%7D%20%2A%20Only%2026,for)

  . Including metrics can therefore immediately put you ahead of a good portion of the competition, from HR’s perspective, because it differentiates your contributions.

- **Skills and Tools:** HR will verify that the key skills needed are evident in the resume. This includes technical skills, languages, software, etc., as well as any soft skills that are particularly vital for the role (e.g. stakeholder management, public speaking for a training role, etc.). They may also look for **breadth vs. depth** of skills depending on the role – some roles value a diverse skill set, others want deep expertise in a particular tech. The resume should convey appropriately what you’re best at.

- **Career Progression and Stability:** They consider if the candidate’s career shows logical progression – growth in responsibility, learning new skills, consistency in the field. A person who has steadily grown from Analyst to Senior Analyst to Manager over a decade in the same industry signals reliability and domain expertise, whereas someone who switched fields drastically or has many short stints might raise questions. That doesn’t mean career changers are doomed; it just means HR might look closer for *transferable skills* if the experience isn’t directly linear. In such cases, a well-written summary or cover letter can help connect the dots (more on cover letters soon).

- **Cultural Fit and Values:** This is harder to gauge from a resume alone, but some companies do look for clues. For example, involvement in volunteer work or certain extracurriculars might appeal if corporate culture values community service. Startups might look for entrepreneurial side projects on a resume (like founding a small business or a hackathon participation) as a sign of proactiveness. Some companies explicitly look for leadership even outside work (club leadership, sports captain, etc.) as an indicator of personality. While ATS won’t screen for these, a human reader might notice and flag these as pluses.

**ATS vs Manual Review – Striking a Balance:** It’s important to understand how ATS filtering and human review interact. Generally, the ATS is used to **narrow the pile** – for a given job opening, there may be hundreds of applications (the average online job posting yields \~250 applicants​

[selectsoftwarereviews.com](https://www.selectsoftwarereviews.com/blog/applicant-tracking-system-statistics#:~:text=%2A%2079,invited%20to%20a%20formal%20interview)

​

[selectsoftwarereviews.com](https://www.selectsoftwarereviews.com/blog/applicant-tracking-system-statistics#:~:text=,invited%20to%20a%20formal%20interview)

). A combination of ATS keyword filtering and recruiter triage might cut that to a more manageable number (say 10–20 candidates) for deeper consideration. Those candidates’ resumes are then read fully by HR and/or the hiring manager. Recruiters are mindful that ATS filtering isn’t perfect – **70% of resumes that don’t match the ATS filters may be immediately removed from consideration​**

[selectsoftwarereviews.com](https://www.selectsoftwarereviews.com/blog/applicant-tracking-system-statistics#:~:text=%E2%80%98ATS,never%20complete%20their%20applications)

​

[selectsoftwarereviews.com](https://www.selectsoftwarereviews.com/blog/applicant-tracking-system-statistics#:~:text=%2A%2070,never%20complete%20their)

, yet at the same time 88% of employers worry that highly qualified people are being inadvertently filtered out​

[selectsoftwarereviews.com](https://www.selectsoftwarereviews.com/blog/applicant-tracking-system-statistics#:~:text=%2A%2088,never%20complete%20their)

. For this reason, many recruiters err on the side of inclusion for borderline cases and will at least skim anything that looks vaguely close, especially if the applicant pool isn’t too large. In high-volume scenarios (like entry-level roles at big brands), though, recruiters heavily rely on ATS rankings and knockouts to manage the load.

**Manual Screening in Different Settings:** In some companies (particularly smaller ones or certain tech companies), recruiters review **every single resume** that comes in, albeit briefly. For example, experienced recruiters from Amazon, Google, Microsoft have noted that they typically *do* look at all applications that aren’t auto-knocked-out​

[thetechresume.com](https://thetechresume.com/samples/ats-myths-busted#:~:text=Filtering%20happens%20with%20human%20intervention%2C,at%20Amazon%2C%20Google%20and%20Microsoft)

​

[thetechresume.com](https://thetechresume.com/samples/ats-myths-busted#:~:text=Tech%20recruiters%20would%20not%20trust,recruiter%20for%20over%2020%20years)

. They load up the ATS interface which lists all applicants (often sorted by application date or by an internal ranking), and then rapidly decide “yes/no/maybe” on each. Amy Miller, an Amazon/Google recruiter, described it as a human filtering: “The list of people in an ATS is organized by date... A real-life person then makes a decision. You can either be rejected... or you progress”​

[thetechresume.com](https://thetechresume.com/samples/ats-myths-busted#:~:text=Filtering%20happens%20with%20human%20intervention%2C,at%20Amazon%2C%20Google%20and%20Microsoft)

​

. So even though ATS did the parsing and maybe highlighted some keywords, a person is making the call. In these situations, having a strong opening profile (good summary, relevant keywords at top, etc.) will catch the recruiter’s eye during that fast triage.

Conversely, in ultra high-volume situations (imagine thousands of applicants), recruiters may only effectively see the ones that the ATS surfaces as top matches or ones who have referral flags, etc. It varies by company and even by role. But **generally, the more senior or specialized the role, the more manual review plays a part**, because the pool is smaller and recruiters take more time per candidate. For junior roles, automation plays a bigger role to cut down the pool.

**The Role of LinkedIn and Online Profiles:** HR departments increasingly use LinkedIn as an extension of the resume. A resume might get you through ATS, but recruiters often click the LinkedIn profile (many ATS directly link the candidate’s profile if provided). In fact, **87% of recruiters use LinkedIn to source or vet candidates**​

[ngpf.org](https://www.ngpf.org/blog/question-of-the-day/question-of-the-day-what-percent-of-employers-use-linkedin-when-evaluating-a-candidate-for-a-job/#:~:text=Behind%20the%20numbers%20)

. They may look for consistency between your resume and LinkedIn, additional recommendations or endorsements, and a fuller picture of your background. LinkedIn may also show mutual connections or networks, which can build confidence in a candidate. Including your LinkedIn URL on your resume can encourage this cross-check. Interestingly, one study found resumes that included a LinkedIn profile got a 13.5% callback rate, compared to 7.9% for those without – a **71% higher callback rate** when LinkedIn was provided​

​

. (However, note that simply having a LinkedIn link isn’t magic; it has to present you well. A near-blank LinkedIn profile can be a slight negative, as another stat showed a “minimal” LinkedIn profile did no better than having none​

​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=received%20a%207.9,hard%20skills%20and%20just%2028)

, presumably because a sparse profile might raise questions or add no value.) The lesson: keep your LinkedIn detailed and up-to-date, and make sure it aligns with your resume (dates, titles, etc. should match). HR will likely see it.

**Cover Letters and Supplementary Materials:** The importance of cover letters can vary widely. Some recruiters swear by them, others admit they rarely read them. Statistics suggest about **26% of recruiters consistently read cover letters and consider them important**​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=%2A%20Almost%20half%20%2847,increase%20hiring%20managers%27%20attention%20to)

, and around 45% of recruiters say that not having a cover letter when one is expected could lead to rejection​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=match%20at%20L673%20,6)

​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=,are%20half%20a%20page%20or)

. Moreover, in certain surveys, as many as 83% of hiring managers stated cover letters play an important role in their decisions​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=match%20at%20L677%20%2A%2083,7)

​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=%2A%2083,7)

 – likely this skews toward roles or companies that explicitly value writing and communication. Many medium-sized companies and startups still place weight on cover letters as a sign of motivation and fit​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=match%20at%20L692%20The%20omission,their%20inclusion%20is%20often%20perceived)

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=The%20omission%20of%20cover%20letters,their%20inclusion%20is%20often%20perceived)

. A strong cover letter can sometimes save an application that is borderline – it *might* convince the reader to give a resume a closer look​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=match%20at%20L677%20%2A%2083,7)

​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=%2A%2083,7)

. On the other hand, a poor or generic cover letter (or none when one was expected) might hurt your chances. Given that 47% of job seekers only provide a cover letter when required and 31% don’t include one at all​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=match%20at%20L704%20,5)

​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=%2A%20Over%2047.4,5)

, supplying a tailored, well-written cover letter could differentiate you in a positive way, especially if the company values them. It’s safest to assume that for professional roles, a cover letter can only help if you put effort into it (unless the posting explicitly says *no* cover letters). HR will read it either during initial screening or before interviews to glean things like your communication skills, enthusiasm for the role, and how well you understand the company. They might also look for explanations that aren’t on the resume (e.g. a career change rationale, willingness to relocate, etc.).

Other supplementary materials could include **portfolios** (common for design, writing, or coding jobs), **GitHub repositories** (for software engineers, evidence of code), or **personal websites**. HR may glance at these if they are relevant and the role requires creativity or coding skills. For example, in marketing or design, a linked portfolio can be decisive. In programming, a GitHub link might be checked to see if you truly code outside of work. Ensure any such links you provide are accessible and professional.

**Common Reasons HR Rejects Candidates (Post-ATS):** After the ATS stage, HR might reject a resume for several classic reasons:

- **Typos/Grammar:** A whopping 77% of hiring professionals will reject a resume if they spot spelling or grammar errors​

  [flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=,on%20their%20resumes%20had%20a)

  . It may seem harsh, but a resume is seen as a work product, and mistakes indicate lack of attention to detail. Always proofread and, if possible, have someone else review for errors. One or two small mistakes can slip by, but anything glaring (like consistently misspelling a technology or your past job titles) can derail your chances.

- **Generic or Too Vague:** If a resume is not tailored at all – for example, a generic objective and a laundry list of duties that don’t match the job opening – HR can tell. They want to see relevance. That’s why customizing resumes for each application yields better results (63% of employers prefer resumes tailored to the specific job posting​

  [flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=%2A%20Approximately%2063,page)

  ). A one-size-fits-all resume, especially if it’s broad, might not resonate with the specific role’s needs.

- **Lack of Evidenced Skills:** If your resume claims skills but provides no context or results using those skills, HR may doubt the depth of your experience. For instance, saying “Expert in project management” without mentioning any projects you managed or outcomes achieved is just a claim. The better approach is to weave skills into accomplishments (e.g. “Utilized project management skills to coordinate cross-functional team of 20, delivering Project X 10% under budget”). HR looks for proof, not just assertions.

- **Job-Hopping or Instability:** Multiple short-term jobs (say, 3-4 roles each under a year) can worry HR about your retention. If there are good reasons (contract roles, relocations, company closures), sometimes a cover letter can preemptively address it. Otherwise, HR might skip such candidates for permanent roles due to fear they’ll leave soon or were let go often.

- **Overqualification or Underqualification:** If a candidate is obviously overqualified (e.g. 20 years experience applying to a mid-level role), HR might be concerned they’ll demand too high a salary or not stay long. Underqualified (missing key requirements) also won’t make the cut typically. However, sometimes a strong cover letter or referral can get an underqualified but high-potential candidate a chance despite the resume – but that’s an exception, not the norm.

- **Inconsistencies or Red Flags:** Any inconsistency (dates that don’t line up, exaggerated titles, unverifiable achievements) can be a red flag. HR may not verify everything at screening, but obvious stretches can cause skepticism. For instance, if someone claims a very high position or result that seems improbable given their career stage, HR might question it. Honesty and clarity are important; if something might look odd (like a demotion or a career gap), it’s often better to address it succinctly in the resume or cover letter (e.g., “took sabbatical for family caregiving 2022”) than to leave the reviewer guessing.

**HR’s Use of Data and Analytics:** Modern HR departments also use analytics in decision-making. They track metrics like how many candidates at each ATS score got interviewed vs. rejected, which sources produce the best hires, etc. Some companies experiment with AI that evaluates resumes beyond keywords – for example, tools that claim to predict job performance based on resume phrasing. These are not yet widespread, but it’s a growing trend. However, even with AI suggestions, ultimately a human makes the call on whom to interview. Recruiters might have dashboards from the ATS showing, say, the “match score” of each resume (like Taleo’s or custom AI ranking)​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20resume%20score,how%20can%20you%20increase%20it)

, and they might use that as a guide. But human intuition and expertise remain critical. Recruiters often have a feel for intangibles that a resume conveys (clarity of thought, personality, etc., gleaned from how it’s written). As one tech recruiter said, even if more automated parsing and AI decisions come, “the outcome shouldn’t be different to a recruiter doing a quick resume scan”​

[thetechresume.com](https://thetechresume.com/samples/ats-myths-busted#:~:text=position%20and%20grabbing%20attention%20with,scan%2C%20do%20make%20a%20difference)

​

 – meaning a good resume that impresses a person should also fare well with AI, and vice versa, if the criteria are aligned.

In summary, HR professionals focus on **quality and fit**. They want to quickly answer: “Does this person meet our requirements, and what value did they bring in their past roles that indicates they’ll succeed here?” A resume that is ATS-optimized will ensure you’re in the running, but a resume that is HR-optimized (clear, credible, results-driven) will secure you that interview call. Always remember both audiences – the algorithm *and* the human – when crafting your resume.

## 4\. Industry-Specific Insights

Hiring practices and resume expectations can differ markedly across industries – what works for a tech startup might not fly in a traditional finance firm, and vice versa. Additionally, norms vary by region (North America vs. Europe vs. Asia, etc.), affecting how you should present yourself. Below, we delve into some **industry-specific differences** and then highlight **regional resume differences** that global job seekers should be aware of.

### Differences Across Industries

**Technology (Software/IT):** The tech industry is generally skills-driven and less formal about resume presentation. What matters most is demonstrating technical competencies and project impact. **Resumes in tech often list a “Technical Skills” section** up front (programming languages, tools, frameworks, etc.) because recruiters and hiring managers in tech want to quickly see if you have experience with the relevant technologies. It’s common to also include personal projects or GitHub links for software developer roles, as proof of coding ability. Tech recruiters will scrutinize your specific contributions: e.g. “built a machine learning model in Python that improved recommendation accuracy by 15%.” Keywords are extremely important (each programming language or tool is a keyword). Also, because many tech companies (especially big ones) get large volumes of applicants, ATS filtering is heavy – ensure every required skill in the job posting appears in your resume if you have it. In terms of format, tech resumes can be a bit less formal; for example, a simple modern design with some color or a personal logo is usually fine (content matters more, but tech is generally open to slightly creative formats as long as ATS can still parse text). Another nuance: the tech sector often values *demonstrable ability over credentials*. While degrees in CS or engineering help, companies like Google, Apple, and others have famously dropped strict degree requirements, focusing instead on coding tests and demonstrated skills. As such, a tech resume should emphasize **projects, algorithms, performance metrics, and specific technologies** over, say, listing every college course. Achievements like “optimized server response time by 30%” or “contributed to open-source project X” carry weight. Soft skills like teamwork and agile collaboration are valued but usually evidenced through the context of projects (e.g. “collaborated in an Agile team environment…”).

**Finance and Banking:** The finance industry tends to be more conservative in resume style and more credentials-focused. **One-page resumes are generally expected in finance**, especially for roles like investment banking, trading, and consulting (at least until you reach executive levels). Recruiters in finance often come from a culture where brevity and directness are prized (think of the classic investment banking analyst resume – one page, lots of numbers). Education prestige can play a big role: listing a top university or a high GPA (if recent) can be important. It’s common to see **GPAs on finance resumes** (if they are strong) and standardized test scores (like CFA levels passed, or even SAT/GMAT for entry-level in some extreme cases). Key finance keywords include financial modeling, valuation, ROI, P&L, asset management, risk analysis, Excel, Bloomberg, etc. Achievements are quantified in dollars or percentages (e.g. “participated in $50M M&A deal”, “reduced budget variance by 10%”). There’s often an expectation of **clean, uncluttered formatting** – black and white, standard font, no headshot (in the U.S.), and clear sections for Education, Experience, Skills, maybe Leadership/Activities for younger candidates. Also, finance resumes might highlight promotions in title (e.g., listing multiple titles under the same firm to show progression) because hierarchy and advancement are notable. Soft skills aren’t usually explicitly stated (you won’t see “great communication” – instead you might show it by “presented analyses to senior executives” etc.). In hiring, top finance companies (like J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs) often recruit from target schools and expect certain resume structures taught by those schools’ career centers. Smaller finance firms often emulate the big ones’ preferences: so even at a boutique, presenting a polished, numbers-driven one-pager like you would for Goldman can be effective.

**Marketing and Creative Fields:** Marketing can span analytical roles (digital marketing, SEO, market research) and creative roles (content creation, graphic design, advertising). For more **creative marketing roles**, the resume itself is sometimes seen as a work sample – people might use a bit of color, an interesting layout, or even an infographic style resume. However, caution: if applying to a larger company that uses ATS, overly designed resumes might backfire (always ensure a plain-text version is ATS-readable). Many creatives will submit a portfolio or Behance/Dribbble profile alongside, which is where the creativity truly shows, and keep the resume moderately straightforward. Marketing resumes benefit from showcasing both creativity and results. For example, highlighting a successful campaign: “Developed social media campaign that increased brand engagement by 250% (from 2k to 7k average likes)”. That shows creative skill and quantifiable impact. Keywords for marketing vary by area: digital marketing roles should include terms like SEO, SEM, click-through rate (CTR), conversion, Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, etc., whereas brand marketing might include brand strategy, storytelling, product launch, etc. Soft skills like communication, creativity, and collaboration are very important in marketing, and many job descriptions list them. So a marketing resume might weave in “collaborated with sales team to align messaging” (showing teamwork) or “led brainstorming sessions” (creativity/leadership). **Industry differences**: e.g. marketing in tech (growth marketing) might value data analytics more, while marketing in a fashion company might value brand and visual skills more. Tailoring the resume to the specific sector of marketing is key. And regionally, marketing roles in certain countries might expect a photo or not (we’ll discuss regional differences next).

**Engineering (Non-software):** Industries like civil, mechanical, electrical engineering have their own norms. Often, **professional licenses** (PE – Professional Engineer, etc.) are critical keywords. Safety certifications, knowledge of specific systems (CAD software like AutoCAD, SolidWorks, etc.) matter a lot. Resumes may include project portfolios (like construction projects completed, patents held, etc.). The tone tends to be formal and detail-oriented. Achievements might be “designed X system resulting in Y% efficiency increase” or “completed 3 projects totaling $10M within schedule”. These fields might still use ATS (especially at large firms like General Electric, etc.), so all the ATS rules apply. But also, in some traditional engineering companies, **chronological CV format** (with more detailed project descriptions) may be used, especially in Europe or other regions where a longer CV is acceptable.

**Healthcare:** Healthcare resumes differ greatly by role. For clinical roles (doctors, nurses, allied health), credentials and education are paramount. You must list **licenses, board certifications, degrees, and sometimes even license numbers**. Keywords for nursing might be things like ICU, patient care, specific procedures, EMR systems (Epic, Cerner), etc. Soft skills like compassionate care, patient education – while important – might be assumed, but some resumes do mention them or show through volunteer work. For administrative healthcare roles (healthcare management, healthcare IT), it blends general business skills with healthcare-specific regulations (HIPAA, Medicare/Medicaid, etc.). Also, in medicine, a **Curriculum Vitae (CV)** rather than a resume is often used, which can be much longer and include publications, research, and detailed education (this is especially true for physicians, researchers, academic roles). In pharmaceutical or biotech industries, resumes would emphasize scientific skills, lab techniques, clinical trial experience, etc. In hiring, many healthcare organizations still use ATS for initial screening (for example, hospitals often use Taleo or similar to manage nurse applications). But the human element is strong: nurse managers or department heads might value recommendations and relevant experience (e.g., a nurse who worked in a Magnet-designated hospital, etc.). Regionally, some countries expect health workers to include a photo, age, etc., but in the US that’s not done.

**Education and Academia:** If you’re in education (K-12 teacher, etc.), often a resume (or a standardized application) is used, but for academia (professorships, research scientists), a multi-page **CV** is expected. Those academic CVs list publications, conferences, teaching experience, and can be 5-10 pages or more. For industry roles, you’d condense that to a resume. Since this question focuses more on industry hiring, suffice to say academic hiring is a world of its own with different processes (committees, etc.) and beyond our scope.

**Consulting:** Management consulting firms (like McKinsey, BCG, etc.) have very stringent resume screening. They expect to see top-tier education, high GPA, evidence of leadership (e.g., “President of X club”), and work experience or internships with brand-name firms if possible. Resumes are typically one page, bullet-point heavy, and every bullet ideally shows an accomplishment with a metric (they love to see “increased efficiency by X%” even in internships or school projects). They also often look for something that shows you’re interesting or a high achiever (winning a competition, speaking multiple languages, etc.). Even if outside consulting, smaller companies or different industries may emulate that level of scrutiny for analytical roles.

**Government and Public Sector:** This is an area where resume norms diverge. For example, U.S. federal government jobs often require a very detailed federal resume (sometimes 4-5 pages) that includes specific information like supervisor contacts, salary, hours worked per week, etc. Those are run through separate systems (USAJobs) and not the typical corporate ATS (though still parsed). In the public sector and NGOs, they may value seeing a combination of skills and a strong commitment to the mission (so mentioning volunteer work or alignment with the cause can help). Outside the U.S., some countries expect a standardized CV format for public jobs.

The main point is, **know your industry’s expectations**. If you’re switching industries, research resumes of people in that field. For instance, a creative marketing-style resume might not do well if you’re applying to a buttoned-up finance job – the finance HR may perceive it as not serious or not the norm. Conversely, a very dense, black-and-white finance resume might seem dull for a creative marketing agency – they might expect a bit more flair or personality. While the ATS will parse text regardless of style, the human reviewers in each industry have their own biases and preferences shaped by industry culture.

### Regional Variations in Hiring Practices

Expectations for resumes/CVs and hiring processes vary globally due to differences in culture, law, and business norms. Here are some key regional insights:

**North America (USA & Canada):** Resumes in North America are typically **one or two pages** (one for early career, two for more experienced). It is standard *not* to include personal details like photo, age, gender, marital status, or nationality on resumes​

[careerhigher.co](https://www.careerhigher.co/career-advice/resume-differences-by-geography-122773/#:~:text=a)

​

[careerhigher.co](https://www.careerhigher.co/career-advice/resume-differences-by-geography-122773/#:~:text=The%20USA%20and%20Canada%20do,skills%20are%20also%20listed%20accordingly)

 – in fact, in the U.S., including a photo or those demographics can raise concerns about EEOC compliance (employers try to avoid seeing that info to prevent bias). The format is straightforward: name and contact info at top, then usually a summary or objective (optional), followed by experience, education, and skills. U.S. employers prefer reverse-chronological order for experience. A **CV** in the U.S. refers only to an academic CV; for other jobs, “resume” is the term and expected format. Recruiters in the U.S. focus on accomplishments and clarity (as discussed in sections above). In Canada, it’s very similar to the U.S., though in some cases a slightly more detailed CV might be used for government roles. Both countries typically require applicants to apply through ATS for larger organizations. **Cover letters** are often expected in North America (especially if requested in the job posting). One interesting stat: 77% of North American companies considered a one-page resume inappropriate for experienced candidates – meaning they *expect* two pages if you have substantial experience​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=,resume%20inappropriate%20for%20an%20experienced)

​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=%2A%20One,resume%20inappropriate%20for%20an%20experienced)

. And as noted earlier, recruiters will spend more time on a two-page resume that’s warranted by experience.

**Europe:** The term **“CV” (Curriculum Vitae)** is commonly used instead of resume in Europe, and formats can vary country by country. In general, European CVs tend to be a bit longer and more detailed than U.S. resumes, and including certain personal information is common (and sometimes legally required to be provided by candidates, though laws are changing). For example, it’s typical in many European countries to include your **date of birth, nationality, and often a professional photograph** on the CV​

[careerhigher.co](https://www.careerhigher.co/career-advice/resume-differences-by-geography-122773/#:~:text=b.%20One%20or%20two,with%20a%20photograph)

​

[careerhigher.co](https://www.careerhigher.co/career-advice/resume-differences-by-geography-122773/#:~:text=In%20many%20European%20countries%2C%20the,professional%20headshot%20in%20these%20countries)

. This is especially true in continental Europe (Germany, France, Spain, Italy, etc.). However, some European countries are moving away from photos due to discrimination concerns. Notably, the **UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Sweden** generally do **not** expect a photo and may favor a two-page CV without one​

[careerhigher.co](https://www.careerhigher.co/career-advice/resume-differences-by-geography-122773/#:~:text=a.%20Two,photograph)

​

[careerhigher.co](https://www.careerhigher.co/career-advice/resume-differences-by-geography-122773/#:~:text=Some%20countries%20like%20the%20UK%2C,your%20additional%20experience%20and%20achievements)

. The UK in particular treats resumes similarly to the US: no photo, focus on accomplishments, typically two pages for experienced folks. In contrast, **Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, Austria, Denmark, Norway, etc.** commonly accept a CV of one to two pages that **does include a photo and personal details**​

[careerhigher.co](https://www.careerhigher.co/career-advice/resume-differences-by-geography-122773/#:~:text=b.%20One%20or%20two,with%20a%20photograph)

​

[careerhigher.co](https://www.careerhigher.co/career-advice/resume-differences-by-geography-122773/#:~:text=In%20many%20European%20countries%2C%20the,professional%20headshot%20in%20these%20countries)

. In Germany, for instance, it’s normal to list marital status and even have a section for date of birth. European CVs also often include sections like **Language skills** (with proficiency levels) more prominently, reflecting the multilingual nature of the EU job market. Education can be detailed (with thesis titles for academic roles, etc.). Some European countries have their own standard templates, like the **Europass CV** (a standardized EU format), though not all employers love it, it’s sometimes used for consistency. Hiring practices: Europe has more structured apprenticeship and qualification systems in some fields, so listing formal qualifications (certifications, training courses) is important. Recruiters in Europe may place relatively more weight on formal education and diplomas compared to some U.S. employers, but this is changing in tech fields. Also, **privacy laws** like GDPR have influenced hiring – companies must be careful how they handle personal data on CVs. Interestingly, because of GDPR, some companies in Europe explicitly ask candidates *not* to include photos or extra personal data, to reduce liability; always read the job posting carefully for such instructions.

**Asia-Pacific:** It’s a diverse region, so breaking it down:

- **East Asia (China, Japan, South Korea):** These countries traditionally have very different job application styles. For example, Japan has the **rirekisho**, a standard resume format, often filled out by hand or as a form, which includes personal info like birthdate, a professional photo, marital status, etc. It’s usually concise (1-2 pages) and factual, focusing on education and work history with less on self-promotion or “soft” accomplishments. However, global companies in Japan may accept Western-style resumes too. In **China**, resumes (CVs) for corporate jobs can include photo, DOB, etc., and are often a bit longer, listing education, work, skills. It’s also common to include a line about **expected salary** or personal objective in some Chinese resumes. English resumes for multinational companies in China/HK might resemble U.S. style but still, many candidates put photos. In **South Korea**, including a photo and personal details is common as well, and there’s even emphasis on things like your *family background* in some traditional contexts (though that’s slowly fading). Across East Asia, there is a high emphasis on education pedigree (which university you graduated from can significantly impact hiring in countries like South Korea, China, and Japan). It’s also common to list specific exam scores or English proficiency tests (like TOEIC score) if relevant. Resumes might also include hobbies or personal interests more often than in the US, as companies sometimes view them as reflecting character. However, Western multinationals operating in these countries are aware of global standards, so they won’t penalize someone for not including a photo if they’re used to U.S. hiring norms – but local firms might expect the traditional format. And of course, language: resumes are usually in the local language unless it’s for an English-speaking role.

- **South/Southeast Asia:** In countries like **India, Pakistan, Bangladesh**, etc., the term “CV” is often used and resumes can be longer (2-3 pages even for moderately experienced folks is common). It’s not unusual to see a fresher (new grad) CV of 2 pages in India, including lots of academic details, projects, etc. Indian CVs often include date of birth, marital status, and sometimes even father’s name or passport info – holdovers from old format, though top IT companies and MNCs don’t require those now. A picture is less common in India on resumes (except maybe for certain jobs like modeling or acting, or sometimes on high-end executive CVs, but generally Indian resumes, especially for IT, do not have photos). However, in **Southeast Asia**, like **Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam**, including a photo is more common culturally​

  [careerhigher.co](https://www.careerhigher.co/career-advice/resume-differences-by-geography-122773/#:~:text=c)

  ​

  [careerhigher.co](https://www.careerhigher.co/career-advice/resume-differences-by-geography-122773/#:~:text=Countries%20like%20Singapore%2C%20the%20Philippines%2C,pages%20based%20on%20relevant%20experience)

  . Singapore, being very international, sees both: many candidates follow Western style (no photo), but some include it – it often depends on the company (multinational vs local). In the **Philippines**, resumes (sometimes called biodata) often include personal info and a photo as well. **Malaysia/Indonesia**: photo and personal details are commonly included. **Australia and New Zealand:** These follow a style closer to the UK – typically no photo, no birthdate, etc., and a 2-3 page resume is acceptable. Australia in particular expects a fairly detailed account of responsibilities and achievements. They also value including referees (references) or stating that they are available on request. Also, because of working rights issues, it’s common to mention citizenship or visa status on resumes in Aus/NZ, which is not usually done in U.S. resumes. In **Gulf countries (Middle East)**: Many companies there expect a photo and personal info, similar to some Asian and European norms. As noted in a reference, Gulf region employers prefer detailed CVs (2-3 pages) including personal details and a picture​

  .

- **South Asia (India/Pakistan etc.) specific note:** While including personal info isn’t strictly required, it’s not a cause for rejection if you do – employers there are used to seeing it. There’s a note in the CareerHigher reference that in South Asia, resumes don’t follow hard rules on personal info – applications won’t be rejected or accepted just based on including or omitting a photo​

  . So you have flexibility, but including it is common practice.

**Africa:** Africa is again diverse. Generally, in many African countries, a CV would include personal details (nationality, maybe ID number, and photo in some cases). **North African countries** often follow the French/European format (e.g. in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia – French-style CV with photo and personal data is common, given cultural and linguistic ties to France)​

. **Sub-Saharan Africa** varies: Anglophone countries (like Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa) often follow a mix of UK and local practices. In South Africa, for example, it’s common to include things like ID number, race (because of affirmative action/BEE policies), and even driver’s license on CVs for certain jobs​

[careerhigher.co](https://www.careerhigher.co/career-advice/resume-differences-by-geography-122773/#:~:text=Countries%20in%20North%20Africa%20usually,a%20picture%20to%20their%20resumes)

. A photo is not expected in South African resumes typically, interestingly, despite other personal info being listed. In Nigeria or Ghana, candidates might include date of birth and marital status, and sometimes a photo, although multinational employers might not require it. Africa also has a high emphasis on academic qualifications in many places, so listing degrees, diplomas, etc. in detail can be important.

**Latin America:** In **South America**, practices can be a blend of North American and European. For example, **Brazil, Argentina, Colombia** – it’s common to have a 1-2 page resume and often to include a photo is accepted (in Brazil it’s common; some employers explicitly request one). Also, personal data like birthdate, marital status may be included. However, many Latin American candidates applying to multinationals follow U.S.-style resumes now (especially if the job ad is in English). Spanish-speaking countries often use the word **“CV”** and may expect more personal info. It was mentioned that in South America adding photographs is expected by many recruiters​

. So, e.g., a Chilean or Peruvian CV might have a photo and personal details. Chile, for instance, often expects a “Curriculum Vitae” with personal info at top. Also, two pages is fine since they often include extracurricular info.

**Conclusion on regional differences:** As a job seeker, always **research the norms of the country and company**. When in doubt, for international positions or global companies, a safe approach is a clean resume without photo and personal demographics (except contact info) – you generally can’t go wrong with that in most meritocratic hiring processes. But if you know the local norm is to include a photo (and you’re applying locally), you might choose to do so in order not to seem out of touch. Just be aware of potential bias – photos can introduce unconscious bias, which is why many global companies discourage them now. Some places legally forbid employers from requesting certain info (e.g., it’s illegal in the U.S. for an employer to ask your age or marital status before hiring). In Europe, anti-discrimination laws exist too, but culturally many people still give the info voluntarily on CVs.

Finally, beyond the resume itself, **hiring processes differ**: e.g., in some European countries, it’s common to have panel interviews and tests, in Japan you might have a very formal process and group orientation, in India employee referrals and competitive exams (for govt/PSU jobs) play a role, etc. But those differences kick in after the resume step.

## 5\. Comparative Analysis of Company Hiring Practices

Different companies – even within the same industry – can have unique hiring philosophies. Let’s examine what some top global companies prioritize in resumes and how smaller companies often emulate or diverge from these practices.

**Tech Giants (Google, Meta/Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple):** These companies receive massive numbers of applications and use ATS plus additional screening (like online assessments) to filter. On the resume front, they tend to look for a combination of **strong technical skills, evidence of problem-solving ability, and impact**. Google, for example, is famous for emphasizing **quantifiable achievements** on resumes. Laszlo Bock, former SVP of People Operations at Google, has advised candidates to use an “X-Y-Z” formula: *“Accomplished \[X\] as measured by \[Y\] by doing \[Z\].*”​

[businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/laszlo-bock-gives-key-to-perfect-resume-2016-10#:~:text=The%20likely%20problem%3A%20Your%20accomplishments,wrote%20in%20a%202014%C2%A0LinkedIn%20post)

​

 – which essentially means every bullet should have what you did, the outcome, and how you achieved it. Google recruiters search for people who have “made a difference” – whether it’s improving a process, achieving a big result, winning a coding contest, etc. They also appreciate resumes that show **learning ability and leadership** (one of Google’s hiring dimensions is “leadership” – not in the sense of direct management necessarily, but taking initiative). So, for Google, having projects or achievements that show you go beyond your job duties can help. In terms of skills, Google of course values CS fundamentals (for tech roles) but they also hire many non-tech roles. Generally, a Google resume that stands out might say something like “Led a team of 4 to optimize data pipeline, reducing query latency by 35%​

[businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/laszlo-bock-gives-key-to-perfect-resume-2016-10#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20take%20this%20sentence,companies%20and%20made%20investment%20recommendations)

​

[businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/laszlo-bock-gives-key-to-perfect-resume-2016-10#:~:text=Bock%20rewrote%20it%20to%20say,portfolio%20based%20on%20resulting%20valuations)

” – concrete improvements are gold. Google has also been known to care about academic performance for new grads (GPAs, etc., though they have downplayed that in recent years).

Meta (Facebook) looks for similar traits: impact at scale and a fast-moving attitude. Their recruiters often say they like to see **metrics like user growth, engagement improvements** if you’ve worked on products, or efficiency gains. They also are big on **open source contributions** for engineering roles (since Facebook uses and contributes to open source, seeing candidates who have done the same is a plus). Culture-wise, Meta values “moving fast” and “taking ownership,” so anecdotally resumes that show entrepreneurial projects or quick career progression can appeal.

Amazon has a distinctive approach with its **Leadership Principles**. While those primarily come up in interviews, a resume that reflects some of those principles can catch attention. For example, “Customer Obsession” – a resume bullet showing you solved a major customer pain point or improved customer satisfaction could align with that. “Dive Deep” – maybe you did a deep analysis to root-cause a problem. Amazon recruiters may look for evidence of huge ownership or frugality (like doing more with less). Also, Amazon tends to be data-driven, so numbers on resumes resonate. It’s known that Amazon is open to non-traditional backgrounds if you can demonstrate those leadership principles and results. An Amazon recruiter might not care as much about pedigree as about what you achieved. (There’s also the fact that Amazon’s ATS is robust; they reportedly even experimented with AI resume screening which they later scrapped due to bias issues – now they rely on recruiters and structured interviews).

Apple values innovation and attention to detail. A resume for Apple might shine if it shows innovative projects (patents, unique designs, creative problem-solving). Also, Apple being very design-oriented, for design roles they may expect a beautiful portfolio. For technical roles, they still want to see solid engineering but perhaps a bit more emphasis on quality and craftsmanship (for instance, mentioning you wrote high-quality, maintainable code or designed a seamless user experience might resonate).

**All these tech giants also place a premium on cultural fit** – often phrased as being “Googley” or fitting the Facebook culture, etc. They won’t get that purely from a resume, but sometimes extracurriculars or passions on a resume can spark positive impressions (e.g., involvement in interesting hobbies or volunteer work, especially if it aligns with company values like STEM education outreach, etc.). Keep in mind these companies also heavily leverage **referrals** – an internal referral can cause your resume to be reviewed more closely.

**Automotive/Engineering Giants (Tesla, SpaceX):** Elon Musk’s companies (Tesla, SpaceX, and now ventures like X/Twitter) are known for a very demanding culture. Musk has explicitly said he doesn’t care about degrees or traditional credentials: *“We don’t care where you went to school or even if you went to school… Just show us your code.*”​

[timesofindia.indiatimes.com](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/want-to-work-for-elon-musk-he-doesnt-care-about-your-college/articleshow/117272632.cms#:~:text=Elon%20Musk%20has%20shredded%20the,%E2%80%9D)

[timesofindia.indiatimes.com](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/want-to-work-for-elon-musk-he-doesnt-care-about-your-college/articleshow/117272632.cms#:~:text=software%20engineers%20to%20help%20create,In%20an%20era%20where%20Silicon)

. Tesla and SpaceX famously ask for practical evidence of skills – for engineering roles they might ask for design portfolios or even give technical tests. On your resume, if applying to these companies, showcasing **hands-on projects, extreme technical feats, and a passion for the mission** will help. For instance, SpaceX likely loves to see personal projects in rocketry, robotics competitions, coding side projects, etc. Tesla might be impressed by someone who built their own electric vehicle in their garage or led significant projects at previous auto companies. They likely also look at whether you’ve worked very hard and achieved under pressure (since their environment is intense). So highlighting instances of delivering under tight timelines or with limited resources might align with their values. For non-engineering roles at these companies, the ethos is still “smart, adaptable, 80-hour-week capable” – not that you state you can work 80 hours, but any indication of strong work ethic (like running a business on the side, multiple responsibilities) could be seen positively. Musk’s hiring is also known to involve riddles or unusual interview questions – but that’s beyond the resume. The resume’s job is to get you in the door by showing **exceptional ability or potential**. A generic resume without standout points may not capture interest at a company like Tesla that prides itself on hiring the best and brightest willing to push limits.

**Finance Powerhouses (J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, etc.):** Big banks have a fairly standardized view of resumes. They heavily recruit from specific universities and internship programs. On resumes, they look for **academic excellence (high GPA, honors), relevant internships (maybe at other banks or finance institutions), and leadership or initiative (like being an officer in a finance club or having some unique achievement).** If you’re aiming for a top bank, things like the **name of your school and major (preferably finance, economics, business, or math)**, any finance certifications (Series exams, CFA level I if you have it), and big brand names in experience (even if a short internship at, say, Morgan Stanley – it signals credibility) will make a difference. They also value numerical results: e.g. “Analyzed 10 prospective M&A deals, contributed to pitch that resulted in $100M deal closure” – even if you were just a small part, phrasing it as an achievement is common practice. For more senior roles, a strong track record of revenue or client acquisition is key. Smaller financial firms often try to mirror these preferences: they’ll look for similar backgrounds (maybe they can’t get Harvard MBAs, but they might still prefer top local university grads or people trained at big banks). One difference: some large banks use competency-based hiring now, meaning they expect to see certain competencies evidenced (teamwork, analytical thinking, etc.). They might use automated keyword checks or ask behavioral questions later to gauge this.

**Consulting Firms (e.g., McKinsey, Deloitte consulting):** They emphasize **structured problem-solving, academic success, and leadership**. Resumes to these firms should highlight *big accomplishments in a concise way*. McKinsey literally looks for “evidence of leadership and impact.” That can be in any domain – could be you led a student organization to win a national award, or you improved a business process in a past job saving money. They also like to see something unique that makes you interesting (say, international experience, or a major scholarship, etc.). Many consulting applicants list extracurricular leadership (sports captain, club president) because consulting firms value well-rounded high achievers, not just book smart. The resume format is standard (one page, bullets). Smaller consulting firms will often emulate the McKinsey-level criteria but perhaps with slightly lower expectations (they might not require a 3.9 GPA from an Ivy League, but they still want top performers).

**Manufacturing/Traditional Corporations (GE, Siemens, etc.):** These companies often want a mix of technical skill and stability. They may appreciate resumes that show a long-term progression and loyalty in previous jobs, because they often hire for the long haul. They also value safety and process adherence if relevant (so mentioning you follow Six Sigma or Lean manufacturing, etc., can be a plus). Achievements in these contexts could be process improvements, cost savings, quality improvements. They also often have rigorous ATS screening for specific degrees (like requiring an engineering degree for engineering roles, etc.). A smaller company in manufacturing might not have such a strict ATS, but they still look for the same core skills and might rely on the resume to check those off.

**Startups and Small Companies:** Startups (particularly early-stage ones) often have very informal hiring processes. They might not even use an ATS; the hiring manager or founder could be directly reading resumes. In these cases, **demonstrated passion, versatility, and cultural fit** can outweigh formal credentials. A startup might be impressed by a candidate who taught themselves skills and built something on their own, even if they lack a fancy degree. They often like to see entrepreneurial spirit – e.g. if you founded a small business or a side project, put it on your resume, as startups appreciate that drive. Also, small companies may give weight to cover letters or personal stories to gauge fit. However, as startups grow, they start mimicking big company practices. Many mid-size companies (100-500 employees) do implement ATS and semi-formal processes, often copying what they experienced at larger firms. For instance, a mid-size tech company might say “Google looks for this, so should we” – they might set high bars for coding ability, educational background, etc., even if they’re smaller. In some cases, small firms might actually be *more* picky on resumes because they have fewer hires to make and each one is crucial; they might have an “ideal candidate” image often influenced by what they see at top companies. On the other hand, they might be more willing to take a chance on a non-traditional candidate if they come recommended or wow them in an interview, since they have flexibility.

**Emulating Large Corp Processes:** It’s common to see even fairly small companies using ATS software (sometimes free or cheap ones) and copying interview techniques from big companies. For example, a 50-person company might use a template from Google for interviewing software engineers (like algorithm tests) and similarly, they might filter resumes for CS degrees from good schools, because that’s what Google does. In finance, a small investment firm might specifically seek ex-big bank candidates because they trust those training grounds. In this way, the preferences of industry leaders trickle down. This means as an applicant, aiming to meet the standards of the top players in your industry will usually also prepare you for the smaller ones, since they’re often looking for similar qualities (just maybe with slightly different thresholds or more flexibility on some points).

**Differences in Emphasis:** While large companies can be rigid about requirements (e.g., “must have 5+ years experience, MBA preferred”), a small company might be more flexible if a candidate shows great potential or can wear multiple hats. Large companies can afford specialists; small ones often need generalists. So on a resume for a small company, showing a broad skill set and adaptability can be beneficial (e.g., if you’re applying to a startup as a marketer, noting that you also have some coding knowledge or design skills could be a plus since you may be doing varied tasks). Big companies might prefer depth in one area, while small companies value breadth (depending on role).

**Company Culture Reflected in Resume Preferences:** A company like **Netflix**, which is known for its strong culture memo, might value a resume that shows independent thinking and high performance (they have a “keeper test” philosophy – only keep employees who you would fight to keep). While that is hard to convey on a resume, a track record of promotions or big recognitions could hint at it. Meanwhile a company like **IBM**, being very established, might look more for stability and deep expertise in a given domain (so a more traditional CV listing lots of projects/patents might be welcome).

In essence, while ATS and keyword optimization get you into the consideration set, **each company’s recruiters are subconsciously looking for signals that align with their company’s values and needs**. When targeting specific companies, it can help to research what those are. For example, if applying to Google, read their careers blog or guide – Google has published tips (like Laszlo Bock’s advice) and they even have a resume prep page saying they like to see your impact and want it concise. For Amazon, read the Leadership Principles and think if any can be subtly reflected in your resume bullets (e.g., mention if you “Mentored and developed 3 junior analysts” which touches “Hire and Develop the Best”). For JPMorgan, maybe see if any alumni or recruiters have spoken about what they seek (often: integrity, teamwork, drive, numeracy). Aligning your resume to a company doesn’t mean changing facts, just highlighting the aspects of your experience that resonate with that company’s known focus.

Finally, remember that **smaller companies often rely more on networking and referrals**, whereas large companies process huge volumes through ATS. A referred candidate at a small company might bypass a lot of formality (their resume still matters, but it might be read more forgivingly). At large firms, referrals also help – referred resumes often get flagged in ATS for recruiter attention. So in comparing hiring practices, one commonality is that a strong resume matters everywhere, but the avenues to get it seen (and the exact criteria weighed) can differ by company size and brand.

## 6\. Full Breakdown of the Hiring Process

To put everything in context, here’s an end-to-end overview of a typical hiring process, from job posting to offer, highlighting where ATS and human decisions come into play and how these steps can vary by company size:

**1. Job Opening and Job Description Creation:** The process begins when a department identifies a need (a new role or backfill for a departing employee). A **hiring manager** (the person who will supervise the new hire) defines the requirements for the role – the responsibilities, required qualifications, and ideal candidate profile. In larger companies, this is formalized into a **job description (JD)** often in collaboration with HR. The JD is critical because its contents will feed directly into ATS keyword filters and what the hiring team looks for. It typically lists required experience, education, skills (often split into “must-haves” and “nice-to-haves”), as well as a description of duties. For example, a JD might say “3-5 years experience in marketing; proficiency with SEO, Google Analytics; strong communication skills; MBA preferred.” These details become the criteria by which resumes are screened. The job is then approved by upper management and/or budget officers (especially in large firms, hiring often requires sign-off from finance to ensure there’s headcount budget).

**2. Job Posting and Sourcing Candidates:** Once approved, the job is posted on various channels – the company’s careers page (which is usually tied to their ATS), job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.), and sometimes shared with recruiters or agencies. As soon as the job is live, **applications start coming in** (or recruiters proactively search for candidates). The ATS acts as the central hub collecting all applications. Some companies also source candidates via LinkedIn search or employee referrals. Employee **referrals** are a big source: many firms encourage employees to refer qualified contacts; referred resumes might be tagged in the ATS as referrals, which often get priority for review because referred hires statistically perform well and stay longer. In parallel, internal candidates (people already at the company) might apply or be considered – many companies have an internal mobility process, and those candidates may bypass some steps.

**3. Application Submission and ATS Screening:** When you apply online, typically you either fill fields and/or upload your resume into the ATS. The ATS might prompt some **knockout questions** (e.g., “Are you legally authorized to work in X country?”, “Do you have a Bachelor’s degree?”, etc.)​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=But%20first%20you%20might%20see,some%20knockout%20questions)

. These serve to immediately filter out people who don’t meet basic requirements (if you answer “No” to something required, the ATS can auto-reject or flag you). After that, your resume is parsed and entered into the system. If the ATS has a **questionnaire or assessment** as part of application, you might also complete those (some companies require a personality test or a coding test at the application stage; results might be integrated into your ATS profile).

Next, either automatically or once a recruiter begins reviewing, the ATS will **compare your application to the job requirements**. This can be a simple checklist (the recruiter might filter the database for “Show me all applicants who said Yes to having 5+ years experience” or “keyword = Python” etc.) or a more complex algorithm that gives each resume a match score​

. At this stage, many unqualified applicants are filtered out. One stat claims up to **70% of resumes that don’t meet core criteria are never seen by a human and are removed by the ATS database​**

[selectsoftwarereviews.com](https://www.selectsoftwarereviews.com/blog/applicant-tracking-system-statistics#:~:text=%E2%80%98ATS,never%20complete%20their%20applications)

. The remaining resumes are usually ranked or at least organized for the recruiter to examine.

**4. Recruiter Shortlist Creation (Resume Review):** A **recruiter** (or HR screener) is typically the first human to look at the applications. They will go through the ATS list of candidates – often sorted by some combination of match score and application date. In high-volume postings, they may only look closely at the top X% of matches or those with referral flags. In lower-volume, they try to eyeball everyone who isn’t automatically rejected. The recruiter skims each resume (as discussed in Section 3, sometimes mere seconds at first) to see if the person should move forward. They compare against the job requirements and also any additional cues from the hiring manager (e.g., “we really need someone who has experience in fintech”). They might tag each candidate in the ATS as “advance to phone screen” vs “reject” vs “hold/maybe”. This process can be quick or can take days, depending on volume and how many roles that recruiter is handling.

Often recruiters will have **weekly meetings with the hiring manager** to discuss candidates – they might say “I screened 100 applicants, here are 10 I recommend we speak with.” Hiring managers might also peruse resumes in the ATS directly if they have access, but usually recruiters triage first. Some companies also include a **cover letter review** here if one was submitted – usually if a candidate is borderline, a great cover letter might push them into the yes pile. (As noted, many recruiters don’t read cover letters unless they need an extra data point or it’s a role where writing is crucial.)

The outcome of this stage is a **shortlist of candidates** to contact for initial interviews. The conversion can be drastic: from hundreds of applicants down to perhaps 5–15 candidates that will get a call. Indeed, on average only about **4 to 6 candidates are invited to interviews out of 250+ applications**​

[selectsoftwarereviews.com](https://www.selectsoftwarereviews.com/blog/applicant-tracking-system-statistics#:~:text=%2A%2079,invited%20to%20a%20formal%20interview)

​

[selectsoftwarereviews.com](https://www.selectsoftwarereviews.com/blog/applicant-tracking-system-statistics#:~:text=,invited%20to%20a%20formal%20interview)

. Those odds highlight why optimizing the resume and application is so important.

**5. Initial Interview (Phone/Video Screening):** The first interview is often conducted by the **recruiter** (or sometimes an external recruiter or HR coordinator). This is typically a **phone screen** (\~30 minutes) or a one-way video interview in some cases. The goal here is to verify the resume information, gauge communication skills, and assess basic fit and motivation. Common elements: the recruiter will often ask about your recent experience (“Tell me about your role at X”), probe any obvious questions (like if you’re remote but the job is on-site, are you willing to relocate?), and evaluate enthusiasm for the role/company (“Why are you interested in our company?”). They may also ask about salary expectations at this stage, depending on the company policy. For technical roles, sometimes this stage might include a very basic technical question or two, but usually, in-depth technical evaluation is left to later.

Some companies replace the live recruiter phone screen with a **pre-recorded video Q&A** using tools (HireVue, etc.), where candidates record answers to a set of questions and maybe even have those answers assessed by AI. However, the trend has been controversial, and many companies still prefer a human phone call for the personal touch. If it’s a volume scenario (like a call center job with 1000 applicants), the initial screen might even be done by an **AI chatbot** or a text interview. But generally for mid-level professional jobs, a recruiter phone screen is standard.

After this step, the recruiter (or whoever did it) updates the ATS with notes and flags who should move on. If an interview was one-way, those recordings or AI scores might be attached to the candidate’s ATS profile for the hiring team to review. Companies might cut down the pool further here; for example, if 10 people were phone screened, maybe 5-6 move on to the next stage. Reasons for rejection here could be poor communication, misalignment of interests, or the candidate not actually having the experience their resume suggested. Recruiters also assess professionalism and culture fit in a broad sense at this stage.

**6. Secondary Interviews (Hiring Manager and Team Interviews):** Next, candidates typically interview with the **hiring manager** – the person who would be the boss – and possibly other team members or stakeholders. This can be one or multiple interviews. Many companies now do a **video call (Zoom/Teams)** with the hiring manager if in-person isn’t feasible initially. The hiring manager dives deeper into technical and role-specific questions: they will discuss your past projects, how you would handle scenarios relevant to the job, etc. If the role is technical, this stage often includes a **technical assessment**: for software developers, a coding test or whiteboard challenge; for data analysts, maybe a case study or Excel test; for sales, maybe a role-play; for writing roles, a writing exercise; and so on. Sometimes this technical test is done as a separate step – e.g., the company sends an online coding test after the phone screen and before the manager interview.

Many companies use **structured interviews**, meaning they have predetermined questions often behavioral (“Tell me about a time you did X”) to compare candidates fairly. The hiring manager and others will each have focus areas. For example, one interviewer might focus on technical depth, another on teamwork and culture fit. They will later fill scorecards in the ATS or a hiring system for each candidate, rating them on various competencies.

At smaller companies, interviews might be less formal – an open conversation to feel out mutual fit. At larger companies, it can be a gauntlet: e.g., 3-5 back-to-back interviews in a “round”.

For high-level positions, there could be multiple rounds (an initial team interview round, then a final round with senior executives). For entry-level, often one round with a few interviews is enough.

**Decision-making chain:** After these interviews, there’s typically an **“interview debrief” meeting** or discussion. Interviewers compare notes and decide if the candidate is hireable. In some companies, each interviewer gives a yes/no and justification and the hiring manager or a hiring committee makes the call. Google, for example, historically had hiring committees separate from the team to reduce bias, and a candidate needed to be “approved” based on interview feedback and sometimes an assessment of their resume again (to ensure consistency in hiring standards). Most companies aren’t that elaborate, but still, the hiring manager often heavily weighs team feedback. If one interviewer had strong reservations, they discuss if it’s a deal-breaker or if more info is needed.

The ATS at this stage is tracking everything – interview scheduled dates, feedback entered, etc. It ensures no one is overlooked and helps HR ensure a fair process (also for compliance reasons, records are kept).

**7. Reference Checks and Background Checks:** Once a top candidate (or candidates) emerge, many companies will do reference checks – either informal (the hiring manager calls a couple of the candidate’s former supervisors, often those provided by the candidate) or formal (HR might use a third-party to verify employment dates, check references, etc.). These days, some companies skip references if they trust their interviews, but others see it as critical. Also, nearly all large companies will do a **background check** once they are ready to make an offer. That usually includes criminal record check, verification of employment and education (the ATS might integrate with a background check service that cross-verifies the resume claims), and possibly a credit check for finance roles. A **drug test** might be required for certain industries or locales.

It’s at this stage that any discrepancies on the resume can come back – e.g., if you mis-stated a degree or employment, the background check will flag it. A common cause of offer rescission is if the background check finds that something a candidate claimed (like a degree or certification) was false. So honesty is paramount; if something could be misinterpreted, it’s better to clarify it upfront than have an issue later.

**8. The Offer Decision:** Assuming all goes well, the company decides to extend an offer to the chosen candidate. The recruiter usually is the one to call with the offer, discuss salary, etc., but the compensation is typically decided in conjunction with the hiring manager and HR. They’ll look at the candidate’s current salary (sometimes asked during process, or inferred) and the budgeted range for the role. Many big companies have set bands and levels – based on the candidate’s experience and interview performance, they slot them into a level which corresponds to a salary range. The recruiter might have had the “compensation expectation” talk in the first phone screen to ensure alignment. Now they try to make an attractive offer within their constraints.

For senior hires, sometimes the hiring manager or even a department head might make the offer call to show enthusiasm. The ATS status changes to something like “offer extended” and internally approvals are sometimes needed (compensation might need CFO or HRBP approval if above median, etc. – often done via the ATS/HRIS workflow).

**9. Candidate Acceptance and Onboarding:** The candidate usually is given some time to consider, possibly negotiate. If negotiation happens, it might involve revisiting some approval steps (e.g., bumping salary might need another manager ok). Once accepted, the hiring process closes with either the ATS marking the candidate as “Offer Accepted – Hired” or moving them into an onboarding system. Some modern ATS platforms double as onboarding systems where the candidate then fills out forms for their first day.

At this point, any remaining candidates are typically notified that the position is filled (or kept in pipeline for other roles). Unfortunately, not all companies inform rejected candidates promptly, but best practice is to send a polite rejection via the ATS to everyone who interviewed (and often to those who were screened out earlier too – many ATS can send batch rejection emails to all the “not selected” applicants once the req is closed).

**Impact of Company Size on this Workflow:** Small companies may compress these steps: for example, at a 10-person startup, the “recruiter” might be the CEO or an engineer doing the screening, and they might directly call top candidates, have one or two informal interviews, then hire. They may not have an ATS; instead using email or a simple tracking spreadsheet. This can make the process faster and more personalized, though sometimes less structured (which can introduce bias or inconsistency). Medium companies (say 100-1000 employees) usually have some ATS and an HR team, but each recruiter might handle many roles, and they may not have elaborate hiring committees – the hiring manager’s opinion carries a lot of weight. Large companies (5000+ employees) have the luxury of very systematized processes: you’ll see multiple rounds, standardized evaluations, maybe even things like **assessment centers** (day-long group evaluations) in some cases.

**Use of Automation and Analytics:** Across all stages, **automation** is growing. Some companies use AI to scan candidate video interviews (though some have reduced this due to accuracy and bias concerns). Chatbots might answer candidate questions on the careers site or even schedule interviews (the ATS can send a link for you to pick an interview slot automatically). **Recruitment analytics** dashboards show where candidates drop off in the process, the diversity of the candidate pool at each stage, time-to-fill metrics, etc. For example, an ATS might show that 92% of applicants never complete the lengthy application form​

, prompting companies to simplify it. Data also helps identify bias – e.g., if one interviewer consistently rates certain groups lower, HR can catch that. **Blind hiring** techniques (hiding names or other info) are also sometimes implemented at the screening stage to reduce bias; some ATS can present resumes with names/gender removed for the first review. Automation is also used for **scheduling** – rather than back-and-forth emails, many ATS allow candidates to self-schedule interviews from available time slots, which speeds things up.

**Timeframes:** The hiring process can range from a few weeks to many months. On average, a corporate job posting can take 4-8 weeks from posting to offer. Some of the chokepoints are waiting for enough candidates to apply before shortlisting, scheduling difficulties for interviews (especially if multiple stakeholders), and negotiating internally on hires. Data indicates top candidates are often off the market within **10 days** in current market conditions​

[selectsoftwarereviews.com](https://www.selectsoftwarereviews.com/blog/applicant-tracking-system-statistics#:~:text=,is%20programmed%20to%20look%20for)

​

[selectsoftwarereviews.com](https://www.selectsoftwarereviews.com/blog/applicant-tracking-system-statistics#:~:text=,ATS%E2%80%99%20criteria%20are%20immediately%2025)

, which is why companies try to move quickly on good resumes. That stat encourages employers to streamline steps (some are cutting out one interview round or using text interviews to shave days off).

**On the candidate side:** At each stage, promptly responding and being prepared is key. Many candidates are lost because they took too long to respond to an interview invite or didn’t follow instructions in an assessment. Every communication – from how you submit your resume (did you tailor it?), to how you handle the phone screen, to sending a thank-you email after interviews – can cumulatively influence the final decision.

In summary, the hiring process is a funnel: lots of applicants at the top, filtered by ATS and quick HR review, a subset get interviews, then more intensive scrutiny, leading to one offer (or a few if hiring multiple people). It’s a combination of **automated filtering** and **human judgment** at each stage, with increasing human involvement as the pool narrows. Understanding this funnel can help job seekers position themselves to succeed at each juncture – from optimizing resume keywords to impressing in interviews and providing solid references.

## 7\. Actionable Resume Optimization Strategies

Knowing how ATS and HR evaluate resumes, we can derive concrete strategies to optimize your CV for success. Below is a step-by-step guide and practical tips to maximize your resume’s impact:

### 7.1 Tailor Your Resume for Each Application

**1. Start with the Job Description:** Carefully read the job posting and highlight all key requirements – skills, experiences, degrees, certifications, and even soft skills mentioned. These are your target **keywords and themes**. For example, if a posting emphasizes “project management” and “data analysis,” ensure those exact phrases appear in your resume (assuming you have those skills). You’re essentially doing SEO for one specific “job opening” search. In one analysis, candidates’ resumes on average only matched about 51% of the job description’s keywords​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=,13)

​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=,13)

. Aim to far exceed that by naturally incorporating as many of the JD’s important terms as possible.

**2. Create a Core Resume Template:** Maintain a master resume with all your experiences and accomplishments. Then, for each application, **tailor** a copy of this resume to the job. This means reordering bullet points to emphasize relevant ones, adding or substituting projects that fit the role, and adjusting wording to mirror the job description. It does take time, but it drastically improves your match. 63% of employers favor resumes specifically tailored to the position​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=%2A%20Approximately%2063,page)

​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=%2A%20Approximately%2063,level%20roles.%5E%7B8)

, and doing so also helps ATS match rates. Even a 10-15% difference in content focus can move your resume from a generic submission to a highly relevant one.

**3. Use the Right Title and Headline:** If the job title in the posting is “Marketing Specialist,” and your current title is “Marketing Coordinator” but you essentially perform a specialist role, consider tweaking how you present it. You might write **“Marketing Specialist (Marketing Coordinator), XYZ Corp”** as your title line, to both reflect your official title and the equivalent role. Or use a **professional summary** at the top to state your identity in terms of the target role: e.g. “Results-driven Marketing Specialist with 4 years of experience in digital campaigns and SEO.” This immediately signals to the ATS and reader that you fit the role. One study found resumes with the job title in the resume headline got 3.5 times more interview invitations​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/8-things-you-need-to-know-about-applicant-tracking-systems/#:~:text=analyzed%20nearly%20a%C2%A0million%20job%20searches%C2%A0and,5%20times%C2%A0more%20interview%20invitations)

​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/8-things-you-need-to-know-about-applicant-tracking-systems/#:~:text=If%20you%20can%20predict%20the,keywords%2C%20read%20the%20job%20description)

 – because both ATS ranking and human perception aligned with seeing that title. Just ensure you’re not misrepresenting – framing is fine, outright lying is not. If you’ve never held the title, present it as a targeted headline or in a summary rather than falsifying your employment history.

**4. Incorporate Keywords Thoughtfully:** Build a **“Skills” or “Core Competencies” section** that reflects the key hard skills for the role​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=How%20do%20you%20pass%20the,applicant%20tracking%20system)

​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=Here%20are%20things%20you%20need,to%20pass%20applicant%20tracking%20systems)

. This can be a simple list or a series of keywords separated by bullets or pipes. Many ATS parse this section easily, and it gives a quick snapshot of your capabilities. For instance: *Skills: Project Management | Agile (Scrum) | Data Analysis (Excel, SQL) | Financial Modeling | Stakeholder Communication.* Ensure this includes any software/tools listed in the JD and any certifications (e.g., CPA, PMP). Also integrate these keywords into your experience bullets (ATS might score a keyword higher if it’s in context under a job). If a certain skill is crucial but you have limited experience, find an honest way to include it – e.g., if “Tableau” is required and you only used it in one project, you could have a bullet “Developed a dashboard in Tableau to visualize sales trends, improving data transparency.” This way, you can’t be filtered out for lacking Tableau, and you’ve shown basic competence. Remember to include both acronym and full name of key terms (like “SEO (Search Engine Optimization)” once, thereafter SEO). This ensures you’ll hit whether the recruiter searches one or the other​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-formatting-mistakes/#:~:text=While%20it%20may%20seem%20obvious,so%20obvious%20to%20an%20ATS)

​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-formatting-mistakes/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20if%20a%20hiring,to%20skip%20over%20your%20resume)

.

**5. Align Wording with the Company’s Language:** Use the company’s phrasing from the job ad. If they say “clients” instead of “customers,” mirror that. If they value “cross-functional collaboration,” consider mentioning that phrase if applicable. This isn’t just ATS trickery; it demonstrates that you speak their language and likely fit their culture. But do so naturally – don’t just dump buzzwords. For example, if the job asks for “demonstrated leadership,” you could tweak a bullet from “Led project X…” to “Demonstrated leadership by spearheading project X…”. Subtle shifts can ensure you tick the HR boxes.

### 7.2 Optimize Formatting for ATS and Readability

**6. Choose a Clean, ATS-Friendly Format:** Use a simple layout with clearly labeled sections (Professional Experience, Education, Skills, etc.). Use standard headings – avoid cutesy ones like “My Journey” for experience​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-formatting-mistakes/#:~:text=6)

​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-formatting-mistakes/#:~:text=Sometimes%20job%20seekers%20like%20to,section%20headings%20of%20their%20resumes)

. Standard headings help ATS categorize content correctly. Stick to one column (or at most a main column plus a narrow sidebar for skills, which many ATS can handle). Avoid text boxes or tables for critical text. Use a common font (Calibri, Arial, Times New Roman, Verdana are all safe choices)​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-formatting-mistakes/#:~:text=Once%20again%2C%20this%20mistake%20occurs,Remember%2C%20keep%20it%20simple)

​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-formatting-mistakes/#:~:text=Always%20choose%20fonts%20that%20are,to%20use%20on%20your%20resume)

. Use a font size no smaller than 10 pt for body text. You can add a bit of color or subtle design elements if you want (especially for human appeal), but ensure the content is all selectable text. Test your resume by copying all text into a plain text editor – if everything is in logical order, it’s ATS-safe. If not, adjust (e.g., content in headers/footers might appear out of place – better to remove important info from those regions)​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-formatting-mistakes/#:~:text=Job%20seekers%20sometimes%20put%20additional,footer%29%20of%20their%20resume)

​

.

**7. Use Reverse-Chronological or Hybrid Format:** The **reverse-chronological format** (listing experience from most recent backwards) is the easiest for both ATS and humans to follow​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=Around%2035%20percent%20of%20small,organizations%20use%20ATS)

​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=What%20resume%20format%20is%20best,for%20ATS)

. Functional resumes (grouped by skill rather than job) are *not* recommended for ATS – they often confuse parsing. A hybrid format (brief summary of skills up top, followed by chronological experience) can work well – it front-loads keywords and strengths, then provides context in work history. Ensure each job entry has clear dates (month/year or year) and a location; some ATS might want those fields and could mis-classify without them.

**8. Incorporate Measurable Achievements as Bullet Points:** For each role, use bullet points to describe your accomplishments. Start bullets with strong action verbs (“Improved, Created, Led, Increased, Saved, Implemented…”). Wherever possible, add a numeric result or concrete outcome​

[businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/laszlo-bock-gives-key-to-perfect-resume-2016-10#:~:text=,Bock%20suggests)

​

[businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/laszlo-bock-gives-key-to-perfect-resume-2016-10#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20take%20this%20sentence,companies%20and%20made%20investment%20recommendations)

. E.g., “Increased social media followers by 40% in 6 months” or “Saved $200K annually by optimizing supply chain routes.” These numbers not only impress human readers but also provide ATS with contextual keywords (like % signs, $ amounts, which aren’t specifically searched but indicate quantification). Many ATS will parse numbers and you might even come up in searches like “$1M” if a hiring manager searches the database for those who have managed million-dollar budgets, for example. A Harvard study noted qualified candidates get filtered out due to lack of the right keywords​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/top-resume-keywords-boost-resume/#:~:text=database%2C%20never%20to%20be%20seen,didn%E2%80%99t%20contain%20the%20right%20keywords)

 – often those keywords are embedded in accomplishments. If the JD asks for “cost reduction experience,” having a bullet that explicitly says “Reduced cost by X%” hits that nail on the head.

**9. Address Potential Red Flags Proactively:** If you have an employment gap or are in a different location than the job, consider addressing it briefly on the resume. For a gap, you could add a one-liner like “2020–2021: Career Sabbatical for family care – maintained professional development via \[courses/volunteering\].” This can prevent ATS or recruiter confusion about missing years. For location, if you’re willing to move, you might put the target city in your heading or a note “Open to relocation” (some ATS allow a field for this; if not, you can put it in your summary). Since some ATS filter by local candidates using address, consider using the location in your resume that you intend to be (or “Relocating to X in \[month/year\]”).

**10. Keep Formatting Simple for Dates and Other Fields:** Use consistent date formats (either MMM YYYY or MM/YYYY across all jobs) – inconsistent formats can confuse parsers​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-formatting-mistakes/#:~:text=Whichever%20format%20you%20choose%2C%20be,can%20lead%20to%20incorrect%20parsing)

​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-formatting-mistakes/#:~:text=There%E2%80%99s%20one%20more%20thing%20%E2%80%94,that%20only%20shows%20the%20year)

. Don’t get fancy with how you list things like phone or email – use standard labels like “Email:” or an email icon that hopefully ATS can interpret. For phone numbers, format as +1-234-567-8901 or (234) 567-8901 – both are usually fine. Also, avoid special characters that might not scan – for example, use plain bullet points (• or –) rather than custom wingdings; ATS generally handle standard bullets well. Avoid using all-caps except for maybe section headings – ATS can read caps, but it can reduce readability for humans if overused. One exception: acronyms like “CPA” or “SQL” are fine in caps.

**11. Don’t Hide Keywords in White Text or Trickery:** A bad idea some try is to stuff keywords in white text or tiny font to game the ATS. Many ATS algorithms now flag this (e.g., if a bunch of words are colored white on white background, or the font size is 1pt, the resume might be rejected as spam or the hidden text might be ignored). Plus, if a human sees an inconsistent font section, it destroys trust. It’s better to legitimately incorporate keywords, as described. Also, some ATS provide a \*\*“resume score” or keyword match report to the recruiter​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20resume%20score,how%20can%20you%20increase%20it)

​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=Some%20ATS%20score%20resumes%20based,skill%20set%2C%20education%2C%20and%20more)

; a resume that looks suspiciously stuffed might actually rank but then be dropped by the recruiter upon closer inspection. Honesty and relevance are the safe path.

**12. Use a Compatible File Format:** Most ATS accept **.doc, .docx, or PDF**. Docx is often safest because it’s easily parsed (it’s basically XML). PDF is usually fine too – modern ATS parse PDFs well as long as they’re not scanned images. In fact, contrary to some myths, PDF is typically okay; just use a simple PDF (no embedded media). Some systems (older ones) may prefer Word because parsing PDF can sometimes scramble some order, but generally PDFs preserve design exactly as you want. Check the job application instructions: if they mention a preferred format, use it. Never upload an image (JPEG/PNG) of your resume or an uncommon format like .odt. If given the choice, uploading your nicely formatted resume file is better than using an optional “paste plain text” – when forwarded to hiring managers, the uploaded resume will look better​

.

**13. Keep the Length Reasonable:** For most, 1-2 pages is the target. ATS won’t penalize length​

[careerservices.uic.edu](https://careerservices.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2017/08/Ensure-Your-Resume-Is-Read-ATS.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Do%20feel%20free%20to,Include%20that%20information%20on%20a)

, but remember a human will read it if you get through. If you go to 3 pages, ensure the third page is really offering new, relevant info (often, it isn’t, and could be cut). Academic or C-suite CVs can be longer, but then likely a recruiter or someone will manually handle it. A study found resumes beyond 600 words were less likely to get interviews​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=%2A%20In%20fact%2C%2036,6)

​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=%2A%20In%20fact%2C%2036,13)

, suggesting there is a sweet spot. Focus on quality, not quantity – if something isn’t helping your case for that job, consider removing it or trimming it.

### 7.3 Enhance Content Quality and Clarity

**14. Use the STAR method to write bullets:** For each achievement, try to cover **Situation, Task, Action, Result** briefly. E.g., “Faced with declining sales (situation), tasked to improve online visibility (task), I implemented SEO best practices and rebuilt the website (action), which increased organic traffic 50% in 4 months (result).” In the resume, that becomes: “Implemented SEO improvements on company website, boosting organic traffic 50% in 4 months and reversing a prior sales decline.” This ensures every bullet has context and an outcome, which is persuasive to HR. It answers not just “what did you do” but “what was the benefit.”

**15. Prioritize Achievements over Responsibilities:** Make sure the majority of your bullets show what you **achieved**, not just what you were assigned to do​

[resumepilots.com](https://www.resumepilots.com/blogs/career-advice/how-to-add-metrics-kpis-to-resume-tool?srsltid=AfmBOoquNN-aWp3v9xOLGUTh-9Qmuu91CXSXA1G92bDm5DX0902NYIu0#:~:text=While%20many%20applicants%20effectively%20describe,interested%20in%20seeing%20quantifiable%20accomplishments)

​

[resumepilots.com](https://www.resumepilots.com/blogs/career-advice/how-to-add-metrics-kpis-to-resume-tool?srsltid=AfmBOoquNN-aWp3v9xOLGUTh-9Qmuu91CXSXA1G92bDm5DX0902NYIu0#:~:text=resumes%2C%20recruiters%20are%C2%A0particularly%20interested%20in,seeing%20quantifiable%20accomplishments)

. Anyone can list job duties from a description; what sets you apart is how well you did them. Use strong verbs and avoid weak phrases like “Responsible for managing team” – instead say “Managed a team of 5, achieving…”. It’s more direct and active. Another example: rather than “Worked on customer support tickets,” say “Resolved 20+ customer support tickets weekly, maintaining a 95% satisfaction rating.” The latter demonstrates effectiveness.

**16. Include Relevant Metrics and KPIs:** We’ve stressed this, but it cannot be overstated – whenever you can quantify, do it. If you don’t have exact numbers, estimates are okay if honest (“approximately 15% improvement”, “around $10K savings”). Metrics make your claims **tangible**. Only 26% of resumes have 5+ metrics​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=,13)

​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=%2A%20Candidates%27%20resumes%20contained%2060,13)

 – by being in that minority, you stand out. Think of metrics like: revenue generated, costs saved, time saved, volume handled (customers served, transactions processed), rankings (e.g. top salesperson of quarter), growth rates, engagement rates, etc. Even internal metrics count (reduced error rate by X, improved team efficiency by Y, etc.). If you’re in a role where impact is hard to quantify (say, an executive assistant), you can quantify things like “managed calendar of 3 executives, coordinating 100+ meetings per month” (volume indicates complexity) or “handled travel logistics, cutting average trip cost by 10% via vendor negotiations” (cost savings). Numbers catch the eye​

[businessinsider.com](https://www.businessinsider.com/laszlo-bock-gives-key-to-perfect-resume-2016-10#:~:text=,Bock%20suggests)

​

.

**17. Highlight Key Achievements in Each Role:** If you have multiple bullets under a job, consider bolding a few truly big accomplishments or key words, purely for the human reader’s benefit. E.g., “**Award:** Received Employee of the Year 2022 for…”. But use sparingly – if everything is bold, nothing stands out. Alternatively, you could have a sub-section “Key Achievements:” under each job to draw attention, though that can sometimes repeat bullet info. Usually integrating in bullets is fine.

**18. Use Consistent Language and Avoid Jargon (unless industry-specific):** Use terminology the hiring organization will understand. Some companies have internal names for things – don’t use those externally. For instance, if you worked at a company that calls its customers “members,” but the rest of the world says “customers,” consider saying “customers” to avoid any ambiguity. However, do use true industry jargon that the hiring company would expect. If you’re in IT, saying “CI/CD pipeline” or “ETL process” is fine – those are standard terms. An ATS might even flag unusual acronyms to review. If you have space, introduce an acronym by its full name on first use (e.g., “Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)”), then you can use “KPI” later freely.

**19. Check for Errors and Clarity:** After tailoring and writing, proofread thoroughly. Run spell check, but also read it manually – spell check won’t catch if you wrote “manger” instead of “manager,” which ATS or HR might see as a typo or even parse as something else. Ensure consistent formatting (if one job says “Jan 2019 – Mar 2021”, do the others the same way). Look at alignment and spacing – a sloppy-looking resume might suggest a sloppy worker. Also, ensure your contact info is up to date and professional (use a professional-sounding email, ideally just your name; avoid jokey emails). Given 77% of hiring pros reject for grammar/spelling errors​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=,on%20their%20resumes%20had%20a)

, even one mistake can cost you – so triple-check.

**20. Get Feedback or Use Tools:** Use a friend, mentor, or career counselor to review your resume. They might spot unclear points or suggest stronger wording. You can also leverage online tools: for example, run your resume through an ATS simulator or scanner like Jobscan to see how it scores for a particular job – it will tell you what keywords you’re missing or if formatting is an issue​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=To%20increase%20your%20score%2C%20read,keywords%20that%20are%20hard%20skills)

​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems#:~:text=analysis%2C%20project%20management%2C%20Python%2C%20and,SEO)

. Some AI tools can also check tone and brevity. While you shouldn’t let a tool rewrite your resume devoid of personal touch, these can be good checks. For instance, Jobscan’s resume scanner will point out if your dates are formatted inconsistently or if you have an abbreviation without the long form​

[jobscan.co](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-formatting-mistakes/#:~:text=While%20it%20may%20seem%20obvious,so%20obvious%20to%20an%20ATS)

. Use that feedback to refine.

### 7.4 Common Mistakes to Avoid

**21. Don’t Overload with Buzzwords or Clichés:** Words like “team player,” “hard-working,” “go-getter” are overused and *tell* nothing – it’s better to show via achievements. In fact, 51% of resumes contain buzzwords or clichés​

, which means they all blur together. Stand out by using concrete descriptors. Instead of “dynamic self-starter,” say what you actually did dynamically (e.g., “Initiated X project” shows self-starting). Recruiters glaze over empty adjectives.

**22. Don’t Include Irrelevant Info:** Tailoring means also removing things that aren’t pertinent. If you’re applying for a software job, that two-line bullet about your college part-time job as a cashier may not be needed (unless you’re early career and that’s to show work ethic – but still, focus on relevant aspects like “worked 20 hrs/week while full-time student” if trying to show grit). Also, in the US and many places, do not include personal details like age, religion, political affiliation, photo (unless required) – they are irrelevant and can introduce bias. Hobbies should only be included if space permits and if they are either conversation starters or reflect skills (e.g., captain of a sports team might reflect leadership, or playing chess might reflect strategic thinking – but use discretion).

**23. Don’t Mix Up Pronouns or Write in First Person:** Resumes are typically written in first person implied (no “I” statements). Also avoid third person. Just start sentences with verbs. For example, not “I managed a team of 5” and not “John managed a team of 5”, but simply “Managed a team of 5…”. Also keep tenses consistent (current job bullets in present tense, past jobs in past tense).

**24. Avoid Graphics or Images on the Resume:** Unless you are in a design field and even then you’d provide a portfolio separately. Company logos or skill bar charts often don’t parse and add little value. An ATS might strip them out anyway. If you want to show proficiency, do it in text (e.g., “Spanish – Fluent; French – Conversational” rather than a graphic of flags or circles). If applying in regions where a photo is expected, make sure it’s a professional-looking headshot embedded in an upper corner in a way that doesn’t disrupt text flow (some ATS may ignore the image which is fine, as long as your text is still all there).

**25. No Unprofessional Details:** Ensure your email and LinkedIn URL are professional (ideally your name; if your LinkedIn URL has a messy string, customize it on LinkedIn to a clean one). Remove anything like marital status or personal ID numbers (common in some countries but not needed unless asked – for privacy it’s better not to list something like a Social Security Number on a resume!). Keep the resume focused on qualifications. Also, don’t include references directly on the resume unless requested. “References available on request” is outdated – it’s assumed. Use that space for more relevant info.

**26. Don’t Rely on One Resume for All Jobs:** This reiterates tailoring – a one-size-fits-all resume will inevitably be suboptimal for many positions. Even if you have a strong general resume, tweak the headline, reorder bullets, and adjust keywords for each application. It can significantly raise your ATS match score and relevance. People who mass-apply with the same resume often get mass-rejected. Better to spend extra time on fewer, more targeted applications.

### 7.5 Leverage Tools and Resources

**27. Use Resume Optimization Tools:** There are several online tools designed to help with ATS matching. **Jobscan** is one, where you input the job description text and your resume, and it gives a match report and suggestions​

​

. It might say “Add these 3 keywords: X, Y, Z” (for example, it might notice the JD said “budgeting” but your resume says “budget management” – telling you to use the exact word “budgeting”). It can also flag formatting issues, like unrecognized headings or date styles​

. Other tools include ResumeWorded, SkillSyncer, etc. While they vary in accuracy, they provide a useful baseline. Even Microsoft Word now has a Resume Assistant (powered by LinkedIn) that can suggest improvements in phrasing. These should supplement, not replace, your own judgement. If a tool says your resume is only 60% match, examine the recommended changes and incorporate the ones that make sense.

**28. Grammar and Style Checkers:** Consider running your resume through Grammarly or a similar tool to catch grammar issues or overly complex sentences. Just be careful – sometimes these tools want full sentences, whereas resume bullets can be fragments by design. But they can catch things like inconsistent verb tense or unclear wording.

**29. Network and Get Referrals:** This isn’t a direct resume change, but it greatly boosts your resume’s effectiveness. If you apply via referral, your resume is likely to be reviewed more kindly. A referral might also give you insight on what the company really cares about so you can tweak your resume accordingly (for instance, an insider might say “Make sure you highlight X project because they’re really looking for that experience”). Many jobs are filled through networks or never formally posted (the “hidden job market” – estimated around 70% of jobs are not advertised​

​

[flair.hr](https://flair.hr/en/blog/resume-statistics/#:~:text=%2A%2070,12)

). So, while working on your resume, also work on connecting with people in your target companies. A great resume plus a referral is a golden combination.

**30. Continuous Improvement:** Keep track of how your resume is performing. If you apply to 20 jobs and get zero responses, reassess your resume and strategy. Maybe you need to tailor more, or maybe you’re aiming at roles that are a stretch without addressing some qualifications. If you get phone screens but no further, perhaps your resume is fine but your interview skills need work – or perhaps you slightly oversold something on the resume that you then struggled to talk about (indicating you should adjust it). Consider maintaining a spreadsheet of applications, which includes fields for whether you got to an interview. Sometimes a pattern emerges (e.g., you always get calls from mid-size companies but not Fortune 500 – maybe the Fortune 500 roles had stricter keyword filters you missed or required an MBA you don’t have). Use that data to refine.

**31. Utilize Career Services and Professional Writers (If Needed):** If you’re a student or recent grad, your university likely has a career center that will review your resume. There are also professional resume writers you can hire. They can be hit or miss, so if you do, look for certified resume writers (CPRW) or those with good testimonials. Even AI services like ChatGPT can help brainstorm phrasing (“Suggest 5 resume bullets for a project where I did X”). Just make sure the final product remains true and personalized. In the end, you should be comfortable speaking to every line on your resume in an interview.

**32. Keep Your LinkedIn in Sync:** After polishing your resume, ensure your LinkedIn profile reflects the same key points. Many recruiters will look at your LinkedIn even after reading your resume. In LinkedIn, you have more space to elaborate, but make sure titles, dates, and key achievements line up. Also, add skills on LinkedIn that match those on your resume – recruiters use LinkedIn’s search to find candidates (87% do​

. Endorsements and recommendations on LinkedIn can further validate what’s on your resume.

**33. Prepare Versions if Needed:** If you’re targeting two different types of roles, consider having two versions of your resume, each slanted toward one role type. For example, one version for “Project Manager” positions and one for “Business Analyst” positions, if you can do both. Each will highlight different aspects of your experience. Just be careful to keep them updated and send the right one to each job.

By following these strategies, you’ll increase your chances of getting past automated filters and making a strong impression on hiring teams. It is a meticulous process – involving analysis of each job ad, crafting and tweaking content, and ensuring flawless presentation – but the effort directly correlates to success. A well-optimized resume can be the difference between landing in the “yes” pile versus being passed over. Combine that with solid interviewing, and you’ll markedly improve your overall job search outcomes.
